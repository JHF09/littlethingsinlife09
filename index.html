      There is a girl named stephine who is bullied all the time by her friends
      and also her classmates. There is a bossy girl in the school that is
      causing a lot of problem to her. She cries everyday. She's introverted
      that much that she doesn't likes to even talk to anyone other than her
      brother. She stopped talking to even her parents. Her parents are deemly
      worried about her condition cause even when they tried complaining to the
      principle it didn't stop and when it didn't she stopped talking to anybody
      like she got def. She died from inside. She was at the school ground and
      sitting doing nothing while everyone else was preparing for annual sports
      exam. She isn't even goanna participate cause it's not compulcery. She was
      trashtalked by her friends. Everyone left after the exam was over.
      Stephine was still sitting at the field where it took place. There was a
      beanch but she was sitting near the beanch. Grass is soft enough to sit
      on. Her friend aria came to talk to her. She was the only one who talked.
      <br />
      <br />

      She was sitting with her for a while and stephine didn't said anything for
      years now. Who knows how long it has been. A guy wearing a bag comes near
      the place and sits on top of the bench. This terrifies stephine. She hates
      when people are around her. She remembers that once she was sitting and a
      guy started doing wierd stuff to her. She had to run away. Aria realized
      this incencitiverty. She looked at the guy who was sitting at beanch. He
      was on phone. He looked at aria cause she was looking at him. She quickly
      turned her head and told stephine that he doesn't looks like a bad person.
      She can calm down. Grey hears that. He speaks up. Excuse me. I'm I
      disturbing you two by any chance. Aria says no. It's just, she's sencetive
      to strangers. Grey hears that and decided to leave. Before leaving he
      apologises for making her comfortable. Aria tells grey that he doesn't
      needs to apologise and grey thanks her and leaves and sits somewhere a
      little far on the ground. Aria thinks that guy is rich yet he's willing to
      sit on grass. He must like it too. He took his shoes off. Aria told
      stephine that nice people like them exists so she can stop avoiding people
      and turns out stephine is sitting far from aria cause she doesn't thinks
      of her as a friend anymore. After a few minutes a kid appears. It's
      stephine's brother. She dosen't want to be spotted by her brother here
      cause he'll definetely make her uncomfortable. She hides behind aria and
      sees as her brother goes near grey and sells him something and gives him
      money and aria was also confused. What could her brother have sold that
      man. While turning her brother sota noticed stephine so he shouts her
      name. Seems like she doesn't want to talk to her own brother. Sota came
      near stephine asking what she's doing here. Aria explains that touching
      grass is nice. Sota asks why she's hiding. Grey comes from behind and asks
      if he's the reason she isn't talking to her own brother. Aria explains
      that she's too shy so it's normal for her. Sota says it's not shy. It's
      all their fault. If it wasn't for them then she would have been perfectly
      fine today. Grey was confused. Aria asks what was sota selling grey. Grey
      explains that he found a good computer part in facebook market place.
      <br />
      <br />
      So he decided to buy it knowing it was near his house. Aria asks where
      sota got computer part and turns out his father put it on sell and sota is
      the one who came to delever it. Grey asks how old is sota. And he says
      that he's 8 this month. Grey asks when is his birthday and sota says
      exactly a week later friday. Sota tried talking to his sister and grey
      thought he's being the middle man so he tried leaving but her brother told
      grey to stay. If she won't learn to talk to her own brother in front of
      stranger then how'll she get married one day. Grey agrees to stay for a
      while and asks what her parents are doing now and if they checked any
      therepists yet and they did all they could but she refuses to do anything
      and when she's put on too much pressure she faints insted of talking. Grey
      says that her will power is strong. She doesn't talk no matter what and
      grey tells sota to take it the logical route and try to make her
      comfortable. He asks if she talks to him or not. He tells sota to know
      what her wish is then fuilfil those conditions. She's unable to fit in her
      life that's why she choose such way of life. Maybe a bad history with
      someone or a bad past caused it. He should try to understand his sister
      insted of force things out. Sota thanks for his kind words. Grey says that
      his words aren't kind. He is saying it out of pure genuien ness. If she
      needs help then it's sota's job as a brother. And as a new friend maybe it
      was also his job to give them suggestions.
      <br />
      <br />
      Sota thanks grey and grey leaves. Stephine goes home and doesn't talk to
      sota. Sota asks what she wants. What is wrong. She can feel free to tell
      stephine. She tells sota that she herself doesn't knows what she wants. On
      this side grey goes to a huge party at some bar. He asked arvin what he's
      doing. He announced a party here. Grey didn't expected arvin to grow up to
      do such thing. A party at a bar. In this country. It's sadening for grey
      as a friend. Grey tells arvin that he's leaving. Arvin tells grey that
      he's having a missunderstanding. The party was above the bar where there
      is a good resturant. Grey apologises for thinking out without realizing
      it. Avin tells grey that they are friends. They don't need to apologise.
      Grey doesn't thinks that way. He tells arvin that if he did something
      wrong then he must apologise. That should be a law cause if you did a
      wrong thing then I'd appreciate it. That's how we show kindness to
      eachother. Arvin says that it was his way to show kindness by saying they
      are friends. Grey apologises again for the missunderstaing. A few weeks
      pass by the the bossy girl jessika was harrasing stephine again and
      decided to let some guys harass her and stephine couldn't protect herself.
      She decided to end her life after this but her brother came for the save.
      He was willing to fight for his sister even though he knew he wouldn't
      win.
      <br />
      <br />

      But those guys decided to let go of stephine. Stephine cried a lot at home
      hugging her brother and thanking him saying he saved her life. Her mother
      was hearing her cry from outside since she refuses to talk to her. Only
      her cry is left for her to hear. She decided that she won't go to school
      no matter what. She'll do what it takes to keep her at home. At night
      stephine's fahter comes home and her mother tells him that she decided
      that stephine doesn't needs to go to school anymore. She's their daughter.
      They can't force this hell for their child. Her father told her mother
      that he's trying his best. The father tells the mother that he's crying
      from inside everyday for his daughter. She didn't called him dad for years
      and now this. They did everything they did but the school didn't took
      action. We tried to be careful ourselves to prevent what we can but they
      can't hoep to sit next to her everyday during class. She needs to learn.
      They did learn and if she's running away from everything then everything
      will fall apert. What is worth living when you are trapped inside a cube
      of walls. The wife tells her husband that that cube of wall is her world.
      She is filling everything with her imagination and it's time for them to
      be part of it. The huband says that he won't let his daughter live such a
      worthless life. He'll be as harsh as possible.
      <br />
      <br />
      But he'll not let her stay at that cube of walls forever. If she wants to
      stay quet she can do as she pleases but she won't be trapped in walls. The
      next day stephine goes to school. She didn't got a blink of sleep. Some
      bully came and started hurting her. She accpted it part of her daily
      routine. Seeing such reaction they hurt her head on the beanch and left.
      Aria was seeing everything and decided not to act cause she's too scared
      to do anything otherwise he'll not leave her unharmed. On this side arvin
      says that he'll need to get keys from his brother and grey tells arvin
      that isn't this out old school. Grey asks the gate keeper if he can
      explore and decided to do so. He told arvin that he can go home if he
      doesn't finds grey in the front gate. He'll be at his house then. Arvin
      refuses. He says that he can wait. Grey starts walking and sees various
      classes and visits an class room with no teacher. The kids are creating
      such a mess. Grey asked the kids their names and some can barely write and
      they'll all be in 1st grade next year. Looks good. One of the kids
      recognized grey. It was sota. He asked if grey remembers him and he
      doesn't. He says that his sister has a wierd shyness. Grey remembers sota
      but forgot his name. Grey has too many friends even his friends are
      annoyed when grey forgets their names.
      <br />
      <br />
      Sota thought that he's sister is the poler opposide of grey. Grey then
      tells the kids to study well and grow up to be a man or woman they want to
      be since life is only lived once don't live with regrets. And don't dream
      fairytales, they won't come true. Grey left the class thinking the kids
      were nicer than they were as a kid. Now they realized what it means to be
      a person. Yet some kids lost their innocence and got exposed to this cruel
      world. That isn't good. That isn't what it supposed to be. It's sad that
      he is even thinking about it knowing he can't change the world. He then
      sees a classroom he used to sit a few years ago. How many years has it
      been. 3 or 4. Oh wait it's 5. Grey goes to his class room sees that the
      teacher isn't there and the students aren't making any sound. There is
      just one group talking and laughing. That group looked at grey when he
      came in. Stephine was on her desk sleeping. Grey said that he came to see
      the class room. One of the guy rudely asked grey if he's goanna be in this
      class or anything. Grey says that he used to read in this school so he
      came to see how everything is for once. Who knows if life gives out a
      second chance. One of them threw a bottle at him and he wondered what it
      was for and that group started laughing.
      <br />
      <br />
      He thought they were wierd. This bottle is hard plastic. Are they breaking
      their bottle on purpose. Another guy threw a stapeler on grey's head and
      grey started bleeding. Grey got angry and asked who did it. That guy was
      sitting next to stephine. He pointed at stephine. Stephine woke up and
      looked that grey was angry at her and was moving at her. She was scared
      and started saying don't hit me but grey went out to hold the guy beside
      her and picked him up by coler. He asks what grey thinks he's doing. Grey
      asks him what makes him such a worthless being. That guy trying to get out
      of grey's hands tried punching him but he doghes it. He then uses his leg
      to make him fall. His face hit the ground. Grey told him that serves you
      right. When grey tried to leave that guy told stephine to fight that guy
      who threw him. Means grey. Stephine was shocked. That guy shouted at her
      and she stood up. She came before grey and said she's sorry and started
      beating grey. Grey didn't resisted but he also didn't moved. Grey was
      shocked at first when he heard that name. He remembers her. So this is
      what's happening with her. Grey holds her hands and doesn't let's her
      move.
      <br />
      <br />
      Then he tells her to stop. She even stopped and then that guy shouted
      again. If you stop I'm goanna tell him. Grey- so that's what's going on.
      Grey goes out and tries to get that guy again but a girl comes out in
      front to protect him. She shouts at grey. What do you think you are doing
      creating a mess in our class. Grey slapps her and puts her out of the way.
      Grey called her a bitch. That girl then glared at grey saying that he put
      hand on a woman that's a vilation of female gender. Grey- No no no. I
      didn't hit a woman. I showed you gender equality. I mean you probapally
      want to face the reality that there is no law saying a woman can't get
      away from slapping a man then why would he be violating law. She's a
      feminest right? That bully then comes and grabs grey by coler but grey
      pins him down in an instance. He tells that guy he won't hurt him or make
      him regret all he needs to do is say the name of their leader. That guy
      refuces to tell the leader's name. On this side arvin met with his old
      teacher. That teacher is telling arvin that their school is turning into a
      ganghall. A student littelery stopped speaking cause of it and the
      headteacher isn't doing anything about it. Arvin asks why and william
      explains that it's robert and his father akio.
      <br />
      <br />

      Akio is a truble cause he's a politician and also holds a name in daily
      news paper. Not the head but surely holds a lot of power that's why they
      couldn't do much. It's class b. Arvin says they used to be in that class.
      They reach to that class and sees stephine crying standing and grey is
      holding that guy hostage. William asks grey what he's doing and jessika
      the bossy girl says that this kids suddenly came here and stareted to
      cause a lot of problems. Grey said that she's lying. When he came here
      they threw things at him for no reason and when he asked for reason they
      said he won't let him go. Who is this he. Their leader. Grey won't let a
      single one of them go if they don't say his name. William tells grey to
      calm down. The person they are talking about is robert. Grey let's that
      guy go. He says that if you said it then it must be true sir. Everyone was
      surprised to see grey's respect towars the teacher. Teacher asks what is
      grey goanna do knowing his name. Grey thinks and says that he never heard
      of him. Who eactly is he. William explains everything to grey and after
      hearing it he thought he really can't do anything about him. Not right
      now. That guy warns grey that he's doing a big mistake by stepping on a
      lions tail. He does not know robert. Grey threw something at robert.
      <br />
      <br />

      It cut throw his neck. Grey told robert that he talks too much. Maybe he
      should know it's time to shut up. Go to the infermery office now. That guy
      runs off. Willaim asks what grey threw at him and grey explains that it
      was a broken part of stapeler he threw at him. William told grey to go the
      infermery since he himself is bleeding. Grey starts leaving with arvin.
      Grey stopped. He looked back at stephine and told her that her punches
      were real strong. But one thing grey doesn't understands. A strong person
      with a strong will power liker her is obeying those brain dead nobodys. It
      doesn't makes sence to grey. You are indeed strong and you know it. Grey
      leaves leaving stephine crying. It was shocking since it's been a long
      time they heard her voice. On this side grey met arvin's brother and he
      was shocked to see grey covered in bandages. Some stuff happend and grey
      decided to make a plan for a boom. Stephine went home and remembers that
      grey called her strong. She calls her mom that she's home after a long
      time. She looks herself in the mirror. Her mom was shocked to hear she's
      calling her mom again. She asked her mother if she thinks she's strong.
      Her mother hugs her and tells her that she's strong. stronger that she's
      ever been to be mad at her parents for so long.
      <br />
      <br />
      Her father was so shocked he started crying with his daughter. She went to
      her therepist and he explains that those are the words she needed to hear
      when she was depressed over bullying. Stephine says that she doesn't knows
      if it changed anything at all but for some reason mere vowels were strong
      enough to give her the courage to let her tell her feelings. She started
      crying again. Her father is greatful to that person who made his daughter
      talk after so many years. on this side griffin was sitting next to grey
      and he said- so that's your plan. Grey says yes. He says that his plan is
      pethetic but grey explains that he doesn't cares. As long as they do
      anything at all they can at least feel regret free. And when they die they
      can truely say that they lived with no regret. Griffin is in. So what's
      the plan. Grey said that he just told the plan. A few days pass by and the
      guy robert heard a news. Someone was trying to find his name and beat his
      men up in his school. He was pissed. He asked for the name of the guy and
      he decided to find him down. On this side grey went to Stephine's house
      and sota noticed grey. Grey asked if he can come inside. He sat in the
      living room in front of stephine's mother drinking cofee.
      <br />
      <br />
      Grey asked stephine's mother about her daughter's situation. She talks
      that some guy came in her school she started talking again after that.
      Grey was wondering who that person might be. Sota told her mother that
      she's littelery sitting in front of him. Her mother realizeses and thanks
      grey for everything he has done for her daughter. Grey doesn't realizeses
      it yet. He wonderes what exactly he did. He forgot. Her mother explains
      how grey helped her to gain the courage to talk again but her condition
      didn't improved. Grey asks her what caused this. Her mother tells
      stephine's story that she used to get bullied and there is some stuff eve
      unknown to her. All she knows that her friends don't treat her well. She
      has only one friend in the name of friend who treats her well and that's
      aria. But when she's in danger she's powerless. Grey realizes that this
      aria must be that girl back then. Grey asks if he may talk to her
      daughter. Grey goes to her room and the door is closed. Grey saw her
      sitting on the bed uncomfortably. When stephine saw grey she sat down
      properly. She was about to stand up but grey told her not to react too
      much. Grey sits on the floor. And looks at the room. The room looks quite
      a nice. She must have cleaned it herself. After all she has the world of
      time. Grey asks her if she studies alone in this place. She nods. Grey
      asks if he's making her uncomfortable in anyway. Stephine said no. Grey
      heard the first thing came out of her moute. He was quite surprised. He
      thought that her voice is quite sweet. Grey told stephine that it might be
      quite harsh for her but grey needs to hear what happend with her.
      Everything she knows. He has made a plan with his friends to stop this
      bullying from their school. They used to be a student from that school and
      it feels wrong to see such situation of a person who goes to the same
      school. Maybe they don't have much they can do but anything at all they do
      they can die regretless that they did something in order to stop it.
      Stephine speaks that she's sorry she hit grey. Grey tells her that she
      didn't had any option did she.
      <br />
      <br />
      Grey doesn't mind so she can forget it. Stephine calls out jesssika she's
      a leader of them. They have a few gang members and since jessika is female
      they can't do much. Then there is 4 guys that everyone fears. They are so
      strong and shameless that they will beat you just cause you sat next to
      him without his permission. Then finally comes robert. The son of some
      news paper publishing head or something. He's the publisher and his son
      is... nothing ryms. Grey leaned a lot about the situation and thanks
      stephine for the co operation. It must be hard for her to say out those
      words remembering the bad past. Stephine says nothing. Grey stands up
      tells stephine to have a good day since it's time for him to leave.
      Stephine didn't wanted grey to leave but she didn't said anything. She
      told grey thank you. Grey then left. He told sota if he wants to go with
      him he will buy him a chips and sota agrees to. Grey goes to their school.
      They then watch everything. Sota asks what is grey goanna do in this emty
      class room. Grey first needs to know if the cctv is working or not and
      turns out it is. Grey goes to the back of the school and find some gang
      meeting type. It's a differnt gang or a different branch of the same
      ganag? Grey doesn't knows and asks what's they are doing and they tells
      grey that they are minding their own buisness so he can leave. Grey asks
      if they know robert and they say that yes they know him. He's a friend.
      Grey thinks and leaves with sota. Sota asks are they. Grey told sota not
      to talk. They asks grey's name and grey tells them his name. He leaves.
      Grey let's sota go home and sota asked why grey took him there and grey
      told sota that that place is somwhere a lot of illigal stuff happends.
      <br />
      <br />

      During the time when he was student that place was filled with bush and
      everything so there was no proof left and the teachers never did anything
      about it. Now they have created such a messy place. They never had the
      courage to report them but grey does. Sota asks why no one reported them.
      Grey told him that they were afraid of death. Sota asks if he isn't afraid
      of death. Grey says maybe he is but he doesn't worry cause he know that
      one day all of them may die. Then an entire day passes stephine went to
      school. She was the same. She didn't talked to anybody. Only thing that
      happend was her will to talk to her parents and sota and grey. She was
      forced to talk to a therepist. Aria tried talking to stephine but she
      doesn't want to talk to her. She thinks aria is a traitor for not helping
      her when they hurt her. They came again. Jessika and her team. They threw
      her bang and everything. The teacher came and he did nothing about
      stephine. They threw paper at her and everything. Teacher told them to
      stop but they excused themselves saying they were just playing. Stephine
      tried resisting. In the tiffin preiod she ran away and hide for the sake
      of her safety. She doesn't want to get hurt. She takes it all back. She
      isn't strong. On this side sota came to find his sister who is in the same
      school. He saw the bully gather up in one place and torture stephine.
      Jessika asked where is that guy she brought yesterday. Is he her
      boyfriend. She's so disguisting that she's willing to sleep with anybody
      that is willing to be her pet dog. Where is he now. Those are the words
      Jessika was telling stephine. Sota came to save stephine but they caught
      sota and they are not letting both of them go. They can't do anything to
      sota cause he'll tell every body. The reason they were able to get this
      far bullying stephine was cause she never spoke. It's cause a long time
      ago when they first bullied her they hurt her so much and theretend to cut
      her tong off if she tells anybody.
      <br />
      <br />
      They do the wose with her and sota didn't saw cause he was blind folded
      and tried his best to scream but his face was tied up and he was tied to a
      tree. After they left stephine was left alone with sota. She went to free
      him and started crying holding her brother in silence. Then Jessika went
      to bully aria. There is nothing intresting in bullying her. She's like a
      slave to her. She'll do anything at all in order to not meet robert. Today
      was the day robert came to school. Some other guy was robbed off his money
      by robert and then the teacher told robert that he didn't do his home work
      and robert said someone's name. The teacher then blammed that guy for not
      doing homework and told him to go outside. Then the school ended and
      stephine was barely able to run home peacefully. She is crying. The next
      day she decided not to go to school. Sota also didn't wanted to go to
      school but her mother forced him to go since she is home with her. When
      sota went to school he heard from his classmates that someone made a viral
      video out. When sota sees the video he's so shcoked. On this side
      stephine's mother comes running towards stephine. When she was being
      bullied it's that video. It's viral out. Every face is blurred but the
      exact words can be heard. Then someone theretend that he'll tell somebody
      if he doesn't do it. The name was blurred. Then teacher told robert he
      didn't do his homework and insted punished someone else. Robert's name was
      blurred. But teacher's face wasn't. The title says this is the situation
      of this school. Truely regretable. More than 5 million views 2 million
      likes. and 1 million comments. On this side grey thanks one of his friend
      ali for the footage he stole from cctv's and their secret camera's and
      also audio recorder. Without ali going to school one day before robert
      came to school they wouldn't have done it. Griffin asks what will they do
      now. Grey says that a little hangama.
      <br />
      <br />
      The head teacher was forced to suspend the teacher and was told to stop
      this. Arvin asks why didn't the teachers got this much forced. Grey
      explains everytime the complain was about stop bullying that the students
      did for a while but then there comes robert. Everytime robert's name was
      taken to stop they were powerless. No news of his son would get on paper.
      But on social media it's a different power. On this side stephine's father
      saw the video and was so sad. He did saw the blurrs but it wasn't enough
      to fool him of what happend to her and sota. Sota is smart. Why didn't he
      told him. That's what bothered him. On this side robert saw the video and
      was furious. His 4 strong guys came. Robert asked to know who uploaded
      this video and acording to ip it was uploaded from austrelia. Vpn user.
      hmm. Robert asks about grey. They know everything about grey. He is a
      bright student. None of his parents or relatives live near. He was quite
      easy to know of cause of his vast amount of friends. Even the district
      director's son fall under his friend group. Robert says that it doesn't
      matter. Find out where that mouse lives and then silently. On this side
      jessika was confused about camera's. Where are they. She didn't saw any
      yesterday. They traced the entire school and there was no camera's.
      Depending on the viewing angle they tried locating one of the camera's and
      they found a hidden camera. They try to open the camera and saw that the
      model number and everything else is erased from the camera. They can't
      track who put the camera's. They can try to see who put it throw cctv but
      Jessika won't get a shot to enter. She needs to enter the cctv room some
      how. Which is in principl's room. Jessika decided to forge a plan. She
      waited for principle to go the toilate.
      <br />
      <br />
      Then made someone stand there and lock the door from oustide. She went to
      check the cctv footage and then she figured out who put camera's. The gate
      keeper heard a noice in principal's toilate. He went to open it and the
      principle was furious who locked the toilet from outside. When he went
      back to his room nothing happend. There was nothing missing. Only one
      thing. The mouse for the cctv was kept somewhere else. Someone came to
      check cctv for secret. Jessika told robert that it was grey. Robert
      guessed it. He has already send his men to beat that grey and make him
      learn some lesson. On this side grey was sitting in his house and heard
      some doorbell. He went to see and three guys were standing there entered
      his house andtried kidnaping type thing but grey was strong he got out of
      their hand. They lock the door and tells grey that he has no place to run
      now. Grey thought this might happen but didn't thought they would come to
      his house to beat him. Three guys with rods. Grey remembers they are 4
      main guys. He asked where the 4th guy is. One of them tried to hit grey
      and he was really fast and grey barely missed he jumped in his room. They
      run towads the room and the lighs were turned off. One of them turn it on.
      And seems like there is a whole army of people here. Just 4 more guys than
      grey. And a guy is hanging from the seelging and is taped. They were
      surprised. Grey was suprised they came to beat him. But it was when one of
      them tried to enter from the backdoor. The police is already here. They
      were surprised. Grey said that he never said robert's name in the video
      but sending his men to beat up the guy who uploaded the video means only
      one thing. He's insecure and he's responcible for what happend.
      <br />
      <br />
      Bassically the boss of those people. It's not a case about bullying of
      kids anymore. It's about public harrasement and attempt to murder.
      Stephine's father hear what happend. Robert's people went to hurt grey and
      got caught by him. What is this kid doing? They are goanna kill him. On
      this side robert was getting rest less. He didn't thought this is how it
      would turn out. Of course he did those stuff knowing his own power. In
      this side robert was called by his father. He heard what happend and he is
      scolding him and he tells his father that he failed to get rid of that
      guy. His father tells him that if he has such a bad exicution then it
      would definetely fail. He should confront his enimy himself and in day
      light cause everyone has their guard up in night time. Not now. When
      everything settls down. His father is trying his best to turn it down. On
      this side griffin talks about how weak grey is and grey explains that he
      isn't weak. He may not be as strong as him but he is still strong. Arvin
      talks how it was fun to capture that guy and hung him to the fan. Grey
      get's angry at arvin and asked what would have happend if he chocked to
      death. Arvin said they were careful enough. Grey asked what if they
      weren't carefool enough. Ali tells grey that then they would have went to
      jail together. Grey doesn't thinks it's funny. Ali asks grey about that
      girl who's truama grey broke. Grey says that he doesn't even know what her
      mother meant. All he knows that you are strong is a powerful word for some
      reason. It feels wierd. I mean I don't understand what it might mean to me
      since I am not in her situation but If I were then I would most pobapally
      feel better too. Probapally. On this side school couldn't do anything to
      robert and his gang.
      <br />
      <br />
      Specially Jessika is a problem. Threre is a group of 4 people who are
      wishing that grey would win this war he declared on robert. Among them was
      aria. There was other students too. When jessika started her dominence one
      of the girls finally snapped and started figh with her and it was really
      not wholesome at all. Stephine was there and saw how the preditor was
      payed upon and she was about to win but robert came to class. He kicked
      that girl and remined everyone that they are his dogs. Don't try to
      liberate cause they don't have the power to do so. The entire class falls
      in silence. Robert tells one of his guys to take her to somewhere else.
      There they torture her too much. Robert writes something with pen and
      folds the paper. He then goes near stephine and puts the paper inside her
      moute and slams her face on desk. He tells her to give that thing to the
      person she's fucking with. Stephine doesn't even knows how to meet him.
      She takes out the paper and writes it in a fresh paper. She asks her
      brother about grey. She wants to meet with him. Something important needs
      to be told. Sota thought if she fell in love with him or she is using him
      now since he is willing to protect her. Sota tries looking for grey's
      messeges but he realizes that those messeges are deleted. Sota then tried
      to give friend request to grey and grey declines it immiadiately. Sota
      realizes that he's online. He messeges grey saying Hi I'm sota. Grey
      forgot sota's name again and asks who sota. Sota says that he has a wierd
      sister. Grey asks if he's stephine's brother. Sota was confused.
      <br />
      <br />
      How did he remembers her name but not his name. He asks for his number
      since they need to talk. Grey calls sota using online a video call.
      Stephine goes and hides cause she doesn't want to be in the conversationg.
      She's feeling embarrased. Grey talks to sota and gives out his number. He
      explains that he doesn't wanted to give out his number to randome person
      so he made sure it was him. Grey then asks what was it that he wanted to
      know. Sota tried calling for his siter but she refuses to talk to him in
      person. She started it again hugh. Sota told grey that she wants to tell
      grey something alone. Grey understands the reason for phone number. So
      she's goanna call me now in her room. Sota says that's not exactly what it
      is. Grey went to some resturant and saw stephine coming. They both sat
      there and stephine thanked grey coming for her call. She gave grey a piece
      of paper and he said it's her handwriting. Stephine asked how he know.
      Grey said she is littelery the one who gave him this. She shows the
      original writing. It says a date and says to come at this location if you
      have the guts to do that and come alone. Grey asks what happend to the
      paper. Stephine explains that he put the paper in her mouth and smacked
      her head in the bench. THat's why it is wet. Grey wondered what to do. He
      throws it in the dust bean and tells stephine that it would be foolish for
      people like him to try to negociate. He's definetely planning to hurt him
      over something that he didn't even took his name. He made his mistake by
      sending his people to hurt him. Now he's getting in trouble for that. But
      what is wrong with him since he isn't getting anything done.
      <br />
      <br />
      He's still doing what he's doing. Can't he get arrested for that. The
      police did came to investigate but his father didn't let the police do
      anything. Stephine asks grey what he's doing this. He should maybe stop.
      She understands that grey is a good person but suddenly someone came and
      started doing this much for her makes her feel a little wierd. Grey told
      her that he isn't doing it for her. There is a reason he has right now he
      can't tell anybody but he wants to get rid of this democresy from his
      school. He knows that he can't permenantly remove it. He can't remove this
      short of unfairness from the entire world but he wants to live a worth ful
      life. If not to others then to himself. He wants to tell himself to his
      dead bed that you lived an amazing life. That's what he wants to do. Cause
      not doing something and then regretting it for years. What's the point of
      living then. Better be dead. At least then he'll recieve peace. And
      freedome from those guilts. But that's not something he'll wait for.
      Stephine understands grey's motivation. She then says that now she's
      feeling guilty for bringing grey it all of this. Grey asks her to order
      something insted of reggreting. It's better to have diabetis than regret.
      She ate outside food after a really long time. Seems like she forgot how
      to live a life. She laughs and says that's right. Stephine walks home and
      grey helps her reach there and she asks grey if she ever want to go
      anywhere can he go with her too. Grey said that if she ever needs anything
      from him then he'll be more than happy to acompany her. Stephine goes home
      happy.
      <br />
      <br />
      Grey went home and wondered. He called griffin and told him everything. He
      told grey that it's better not to step in their trap. Is he really an
      idiot to do that. Griffin says that they'll hurt stephine again. Grey says
      that if they do they'll report them again. This time they'll be jailed.
      Bullying and harrasement is jail worthy. And not stopping even after being
      exposed is a whole different crime. That means he aknoleges his wrong
      doing and still is doing. Griffin tells grey that the problem is kids
      don't get arrested so easily. On top of that his father's position is also
      tricky. Grey sits at his room and looks at photos that he took during his
      lifetime. He thinks that three months away is his birthday. He can's
      believe ragging and bullying went this far and he wishes that he can do
      anything about it. Grey get's a call from arvin. Another party is there.
      Grey was bored for this all party thing party that. Yes their celebys is
      over and they are goanna enjoy themselves but why are they not going
      somewhere else like enjoying in sted of doing randome things insted of
      enojing. Arvin explains that they have a large friend group and manage
      such outing will be a bad idea. Grey tells arvin that he just wants to
      make new girlfriends. Grey goes to hear griffin's excuse and he says that
      he doesn't want to leave cause he has to study even though they are doing
      party sometimes. Ali likes the food. None of these idiots know the true
      meaning of fun. On this side stephine's father came home and apologised
      for not noticing how he's been putting hell onto her. She doesn't respond.
      Her father tells her that she is strong and even though she is scared she
      should stand for herself. Defent herself like her brother defended her.
      <br />
      <br />
      Those bully are like dogs outside who'll always shout at her bark at her.
      But she's goanna have to walk right past them. Not cause they are smarter
      than dogs. Cause no dog or dog army can compare with what humanity has
      achieved. If humens feared animals and kept hiding in caves then they
      wouldn't have colonized this earth. She's a human child so she goatta
      colonize her life. She doesn't talks and thinks. Her father pats her head
      and leaves the room. She thinks and wonders what to do. The next day when
      she goes to school robert came to school and he was misstreating her and
      stephine gained courage enough to protect herself but she's not good
      enough. She ended up chocking blood. She was so afraid that she couldn't
      stop crying. Her brother called grey and asked him about what to do about
      this situation. Grey asks sota if his friends don't listen about his
      worries about his sister. Sota explains that his friends don't like to
      listen about his problems. Right now grey is the only guy sota can find
      who can openly give him advice. Grey asks if he can come over their house.
      Sota says sure. Grey goes to stephine's room and asks her what she's
      doing. She says she's sleeping. Grey asks her if she only sleeps all day.
      She says yes. Grey asks her if she isn't goanna ask what grey is doing at
      her house. She says no. Grey kept talking how everything is happening
      outside and some kid fell over he shouldn't laugh but so on so forth.
      Stories after stories. Grey was sittin on the floor. Stephine at one
      started an entire conversation with grey and didn't even realized when it
      was night time.
      <br />
      <br />
      Grey says that it's night already. He needs to go home but stephine asks
      grey not to go home. He can stay over their place. Grey asks her why she
      is wishing such thing and stephine explains that she likes grey's voice.
      Hearing it is gentle and he doesn't forces her to answer. He is some what
      enjoyable. Grey tells her that he'll stay but she needs to fuilfill three
      conditions. One. She needs to convince both of her parents then grey'll
      stay. Second sota will be with them the entire time. And three the door
      can't be closed. It'll stay open the entire time. Stephine says that she
      can't accept the last one. Grey thinks and asks her if she's willing to do
      the other ones and she nods. Grey says fine. She can close the door. Her
      father came and stephine walked to him. And she was hasitant but she said
      it. She wants grey to stay for today. Both her parents agrees and also
      sota needs to be with them. They all eat dinner and grey heard that this
      was the first time she's eating with them after a long time. Grey thought
      that he can feel it throw the awquardness in the air. This was the first
      time her father is meeting grey so he thanks grey for doing what he did.
      Grey tells her father that it's useles to thank him since he doesn't even
      knows the magnitude of impact he did on stephine cause he wasn't there
      when she was in such condition. Stephine's father asks grey what made grey
      think she's strong. Grey thinks and tells it in front of stephine that
      she's desperate like a child. Such mental pressure on herself must mean
      she's strong. And when she was forced to fight him he felt that she had
      anger within her. She lives in fear but that fear has a gathered hate
      inside her that she wants to explore. That's what was going throw his
      brain when he saw stephine first. He thought he needed to let her know of
      what she's unknown of herself. Sometimes we sorround ourselves with
      beautiful or cruel lie in order to staisfy out wants.
      <br />
      <br />
      for stephine's case she thought she was a cower even when she wasnt.
      Slowly believeing in such lie slowly tured into the truth. That's bad.
      That's why grey has his own rules to himself. Don't lie to yourself. Say
      the truth no matter how harsh it might be. And don't live with regret.
      You'll regret it forever. And third try to see things throw someone elses
      point of view cause everyone has different situation and different value
      in judgement. And final. Humane brain is self rightious. That means what
      you think is true will always be true to you no matter what. Cause you
      lack information for your brain to process it. Sometimes even when you are
      present with information you try to deny it in order to tell yourself that
      you were right. Cause you never want to hear you were wrong. For that
      learning to accept what is right and what is wrong is importatant.
      Stephine's father agrees with grey 100% Grey said that's kind of nice
      since every person has different opinions. Her father tells grey that
      stephine refuses to do anything she's being told. What can he do about
      this. Grey tells that she might feel bad for now but he'll say it for her
      good. She right now has a believe that she's alone in the world and no one
      cares for her. That's the reason she seperated herself from others even
      though her parents are actually worried about her. She doesn't even talks
      to her friend cause she doesn't practically help her. The only person she
      talked was her brother cause he'd help her no matter the cause of what the
      situation. It's a selfish survibal behaviour she's showing. Only loving
      her brother cause of her self intrest but that's how it is. She thinks
      that her brother is kind and she must return that kindness but in truth
      her brain knows that if she protects sota then he'll protect her. Is this
      way of thinking true? Stephine doesn't knows. Grey says it's theoretically
      true but in their daily basis and depending on humen judgement it's not
      true. Cause she loves her brother not for selfe intrest but the fact of
      greatfulness. Now if sota were to die she'll give up her life to save him.
      <br />
      <br />
      Is there any self intrest. No cause it's love from greatful ness and not
      self intrest. There is many way she can see a certain situation. Just for
      example she can create a situation where two kids are bullying a kid. If
      it was a movie and you just put a happy music in the baground then it
      would seem like they are playing and doing what children do but when you
      put a differnt colo palet and a sad music it seems like the kid is in
      sevear pain. It's psychology. Her brain is telling her that she's weak and
      hopeless that's why she locked herself in the room refusing to interact in
      the fear of her truama. She needs to fool her brain and believe that she's
      so strong that no one can hurt her or dare to do so. It's definetely not
      true right now but just like her fear if she works on it then this lie can
      also be turned true. And grey can do right now is manupulate herself into
      believe that or proceed in such step. At first it would seem he's pushing
      her too far but just a second later she'll realize it's working. Stephine
      says- manupulate myself. Grey says that sometimes they need to convince
      themselves to stop to begin a new journy. Stephine understands. Grey
      sleeps like a child with sota on the floor while stephine sleep on the
      bed. She wonderes that a guy is sleeping in her room. Feels wierd but it's
      ok. The next morning grey forgot everything and suddenly remembered
      everything. This surprised them. Grey is a cheerful person who laughs no
      matter what. Her parents wonder if grey is good for stephine and both
      parents agree that he is a good kid and the way he's helping her he could
      already be in love with her. Next morning grey was putting his face on the
      table. Was he depressed or something. Sota went to check and figured that
      he was sleeping. Grey was worried about his home cause he left everything
      there and he wants to sleep on his own bed.
      <br />
      <br />
      Stephine's father asks what grey will do next about stephine and grey was
      confused. He already told everything he needs to say to him. This confuses
      all of them. Her mother tells grey that she thought grey will be the one
      who helps her get throw this and grey told her mother that sota called him
      saying that he needs some suggestions for his sisters conditions. That's
      what he did. He talked to her, tried understanding her mentality and know
      the cause of it and explained everything to her father. The rest is upto
      them. Grey tells them that no matter how he looks it throw he might be a
      friend or someone close but in the end he's an outsider. What needs to be
      done by is her own family member to create a stronger bond. Plus he has a
      life of his own so it's kinda hard for him to treat her like a therepist
      without getting paid. Her father tells grey that he's willing to pay him
      if he does so. Grey was surprised and confused. Grey doesn't mean he wants
      money. If he really does try treating her condition then he would never
      charge money from them but it's more about missunderstanding cause he
      didn't came here preapered thinking that he'll need to treat her. For that
      he needs to figure out details and everything. It's too much work and for
      it her father might be the best person to do it. Someone who cares for his
      daughter. Somtimes they have the purest intentions but they fail to show
      it properly that's why they fail to create bonds. Grey can now do can do
      those stuff and in a month or two stephine will be complete normal but
      what'll happend to her point of view. Her father didn't contributed and
      will be sided apart. And grey will be a good friend who did a big favor to
      them. In outside it would be good enough difference but in inside it'll
      stay the same. She'll be cheerful and all but her feeling for her parents
      will stay the same. Stephine's father get's exited and asks grey if he can
      do it.
      <br />
      <br />
      Grey says that he'll take time and her father begs grey to make his
      daughter as cheerful as she once was. Grey thinks and decided to take sota
      and stephine with him. They go to a party short of place. It's near a
      swiming pool. Pool party. Grey tells stephine that she might feel
      uncomfortable around people but she doesn't need to talk. Just hear then
      talk and decide what to do herself. Grey and sota started enjoying
      themselves by making new friends and everything. Arvin comes and asks
      stephine how she is and she doesn't answer. She was getting uncomfortable.
      Arvin tells her that it's fine. She doesn't needs to answer. He knows
      everything from grey. That guy seriously makes too much friends. He
      sometimes get's emotional but his honesty makes him trustworthy on first
      glance. Maybe that's the reason she was able to trust grye. That's just a
      speculation. Stephine talks and tells arvin that she thinks she
      missunderstood herself and others. That's what grey made her realize.
      That's why she's able to talk now and arvin's voice was gentle enough for
      her to get courage to talk. So she needs courage. Arvin then tells
      stephine that his name is arvin and if she needs any help at all she can
      call him. There was a girl that was walking hard and grey went to talk to
      her. Arvin told stephine that she tried to suicide but her family members
      managed to save her. She completely lost her will to live but then again
      grey managed to help her. And now she found a new love for her want.
      Stephine asked what grey did and arvin said that she just had one little
      short conversation that was enough to give her the strength to get over
      her old lover.
      <br />
      <br />
      Stephine asks how arvin knows it's grey who made the biggest impact and
      arvin says that he doesn't knows it himsef but it's obious that his words
      have power. Grey has a wierd logic that all villains should educate
      themselves with vocabelery cause sometimes people missunderstand
      themselves cause they forget the meaning of some words. Some times it
      could be trust, love or confidence or truth. Who know what is your
      forgotten vowel that made you sad. He'll try his best to make anyone
      laugh. Even make fun of himself. He sometimes is annoying. Arvin asks her
      if she want to do anything and stephine doesn't knows. He bring her to a
      shooting range. You need to shoot baloons. There is no price for the
      winner. Stephine said she doesn't needs a price and arvin tells stephine
      that whoever loses have to buy the winner a ice cream. Stephine agrees.
      She easily wins. She wins a ice cream. And she for some reason likes it.
      She never thought eating just a ice cream could be so different. Arvin
      told her that it's cause she earned it. That's why she feels good. On this
      side grey had eaten too much so he went to the toilet to throw up. He lost
      a bet to sota. That idiot. A lot of nice people came to talk to stephine
      and she started feeling comfortble. Some wierd guy them came. He was scary
      but he was treating stephine quite nicely. She was willing to talk to
      someone who treats her nicely but she was still shy and slowly she started
      laughing. Grey saw stephine smiling and talking to people and making
      friends. Sota thanked grey and grey told sota that when he was young he
      used to stay at home all the time. His friends used to play but he
      prefered him. He did talked to them. One day his parents were so worried
      about him that they took him to a therepist. After a few days when grey
      went to a party he realized that it wasn't that he was wierd or anything.
      It was the fact he was alone. He was lacking the environment and made his
      home his castle. Little imagination theater. A world of his own. It's not
      that he didn't knew how to smile. It's that he didn't had the reason to
      smile. By time stephine lost that reason too.
      <br />
      <br />
      That's what he figured and it may look like she's cured but nothing
      changed. She forgot how to enjoy life and only meeting people is she got
      the experience to walk to her will. She needs to learn to do what she
      needs to do for her hapiness and prioritize her wants. Not give up and sad
      up later. She also needs to learn to stay happy alone cause you won't be
      sorrunded by people 24 hour. In the end you need to come back to your
      little dormetory called home. Grey was blowing bubles that he brought from
      the side store. Grey tells sota that life is like those bubles. If he
      keeps poping his dreams or wants insted of trying to acomplish it then
      it'll all be emty. There will be no buble left. No buble means no
      beautiful little shapes in the air means sadness. Stephine came along with
      griffin and arvin. There was that girl too. They started blowing bubles.
      Stephine was confused and stoa started to blow too. Grey gave her a bottle
      and told her to try doing it herself. It looked really cool when all of
      them together did it. Grey said that little things in life. These are the
      wonderful memories that is worth living. Arvin said he wants to take a
      picture and grey tells arvin not to do so. Pictures are not good. It'll
      remind them that they had this much fun that day but they'll not try to re
      create the image again. Arvin doesn't listens and takes a picture anyways.
      Grey wasn't in the picture. Grey said that he didn't wanted to be in the
      pciture. He doesn't likes pictures. Griffin asks what happend to grey.
      <br />
      <br />
      He suddenly deleted all his online photos and grey explains that it was
      not good enough. Grey takes a strong type thing and puts it in the water.
      Then he creates a giant water buble. It was taking the shape of a giant
      buble but it poped right then and there. They were facinated by such
      thing. Now even stephine tried making a big ballon but failed. Stephine
      was happy when she was at home cause of the way her day went. Sota told
      how they had fun and even stephine said that she felt nice to meet so many
      nice people. Sota told what grey told him and stephine's fathre thought
      that the school is the problem. He goatta change the school. It's not like
      he can't but there aren't good school for her. She's in the best school
      but it isn't good in quality delevering. And he can't just admit her
      without using illigal methods. But he'll try to find a good school and
      reples as soon as possible. On this side robert's friends got out of jail.
      They are ready to beat grey up. Not kill cause if they do then it'd be
      impossible to avoide the concequences. On this side grey brought clay. He
      with sota is trying to play with it and stephine said to grey that she
      isn't kid so what's the purpose for bringing that. Grey asked her if she
      played with clay before and she said that she did when she was a kid. Grey
      asks her to do it again. Let's be kids again and try to recall what if
      felt like back then. Stephine accepted grey's request and tried making
      something and she and her brother both suck at making anything at all.
      They saw grey was following a tutorial and after 7 hours of work he
      finally managed to make a dragon.
      <br />
      <br />
      He had to use stcks and everything. His back hurts. Stephine asks grey how
      he did it. Grey tells stephine that he does what he wants to do with
      passon. It doesn't matter how long it'll take cause he knows that as long
      as he puts it into work it won't dissopoint him. Sota takes a pciture.
      Stephine's mother and father also saw the clay thing. Grey then took it on
      hand and threw it on the ground. Stephine was shocked. She asked grey why
      did he distroy it. He made it with so much effort. Grey said that's the
      reason he threw it on ground. It's fun when he works hard to make a
      skulpture and then throws it on ground to make it all the same. It looks
      kinda satisfying. Like seeing domino fall. Grey got an idea. He created a
      giant domino track throw the entire house and told stephine to make to
      fall. She did and it was awsome. Everything was home made. It was extra 2
      hours of work. At the end it created a buzz sound and launched some paper
      on the air creating some cool sparcel and then a paper airplane was shot
      and it his perfect angle the next line of dominos creating a roll which
      created a perfect photo of stephine along with saying thank you for your
      paitence. Grey says that's the magic in it. He claps and says he feels
      sleepy. It's freaking 1 am in night. He spend 4 hours making it and
      stephine thanks grey for it. She understands what grey meant. Working hard
      to see something satisfrying and working hard to make someone else's life
      worth it. She can't express how greatful she is to grey. Grey says he'll
      need to return home and stephine tells grey than he can stay at their
      place. Grey doesn't sees an option. He's too tired. The next day comes.
      Grey is sleeping like a child. Sota wonderes if grey doesn't goes to
      school and stephine wonderes the same thing. Does grey not go to school or
      study. Sota was playing with grey's hair.
      <br />
      <br />
      Stephine saw that and decided to touch his hair himself. Grey woke up and
      asked if he's dead already. Sota says that no. Grey thinks while laying.
      Sota and stephine both still have their hands on grey. Stephine asked grey
      if he goes to school or not and grey says that he quited school. Cause he
      has enough money for his lifetime. Stephine says but if he is doing that
      then that must means he'll never be able to buy anything he wants or
      always need to compromice his choise in order not to run out of money.
      Grey says that he doesn't cares. Schools doesn't teach anything proper
      anyways. It's useless to be there. 5 hours of depression isn't something
      he's willing to have. Grey saw stephine wearing school dress and he asked
      her if she's going to school and to her unlike she is. She nods. Grey
      thought for a while and said her good luck. Don't get yourself killed.
      Stephine asked grey how is this supposed to help her. Isn't her supposed
      to heal her. Grey says that he is doing that. Thinking about ways to make
      her feel better but somet things she should realize already that her life
      never have been helish. It's just that people in her school doesn't treats
      her well. That's their fault not her so grey doesn't sees any potential
      reasoning to say that oh you have such a hard life or something. That
      would be lying. Stephine tries telling her the words grey told her and
      trying to think things throw that way. She thought that grey is the
      perfect guy who thinks logically and doesn't gives unnesessery reactions
      like her. She thinks that grey acts goofy cause he likes to make people
      and himself smile. But she doesn't want to do that. She just wants to
      avoide her problems. Grey says that then she can just avoide them. Avoide
      her bullys.
      <br />
      <br />
      If they want physical contact then avoide it. If they want to speak to her
      then speak. Andswer back. And if they try to hit her then she should fight
      back. Cause as a old saying goes. If you loose in life you die and if you
      don't fight at all you loose so you must fight on in life. Stephine says
      that grey isn't the first person who said it to her. It didn't worked.
      Grey told sota to hit him. Sota tried and grey doghed it and hit him
      insted. He got angry. Then grey told stephine to hit him as hard as she
      can. Grey blocks it. Grey says that it wasn't hard enough. Grey deflects
      it. grey stands up and tells stephine to fight and obejtive of her is to
      land a hit on grye today no matter what. If she passes grey will take her
      to somewhere special. She fights with grey and grey is using only one of
      his hands. While fighting grey got out of the room and where her parents
      were sitting grey went there jumped here and there and deflected
      everything. Sota thought it was fun and joined grey and none of them
      manged to land a blow on grey. Stephine accidently made a hole in the
      wall. She hit grey with the same punch and grey deflected it again and
      grey tried hurting her hair and she lost. Grey said her hair is one of her
      weak points. Grey tells her father to come and hold grey's hair so hard
      that he might scream. He didn't wanted to do it at first but when he did
      grey handed such a blow on his chest that he couldn't breath then he
      managed to get him off balance and holded both his hands in such a way
      that he is fully immobolized. Grey teaches stephine that if her bully is a
      guy this could be an effective way to make sure they can't breath
      properly.
      <br />
      <br />
      This mean time she has 5 seconds hold time but if she looses grip...grey
      looses grip and her father holds controll of grey. Grey then tells
      stephine that this will happen. Grey saw one of the ways they bully her so
      this could be an effective way. If her bully is a female then it wouldn't
      work cause they have stuffed mussel in their chest called brests. They'll
      absobe the impact which will be long time poison for their body but it
      won't let their grip go off. So she needs to punch their stomach. Cause
      it'll stop their controll from their entire body. Grey holded her hair
      suddehly and tightly. He told her to hit him. She did and it wasn't much.
      Grey told her to hit him in the intention to kill. She says that she
      wasn't prepered. Grey says that she'll never be prepared. She will never
      know when she'll fall into harder to hardest situation so she'll need to
      act. Hit in the intention to kill. She wants to liberet from her truama
      doesn't she. Stephine's mother says that it's getting too much but her
      father knows that this much is needed for her own good. She manages to hit
      grey. Too bad grey is strong. He says stronger. and she hits grey with all
      her might and forces grey to push off. Grey fell and said that she didn't
      immobolized him. Now he can hit her. She says that she doesn't want to hit
      him For some reason. Even when he's acting badly to her. She just doesn't
      want to hit him. One more thing she needs to remember that she has benches
      in her school. The pointy part of any beanch could be super effective if
      she wishes to win a fight easily. Sota tells stephine that she's getting
      late for school. She goes to school running and she looks at aria. She's
      been avoiding her for years now cause of her self intret but maybe she's
      just as helpless as she is. She decided to say hi to aria.
      <br />
      <br />
      Aria was happy and shocked to hear that. When one of the bully came
      stephine says that she isn't looking for trouble. They asks where her
      boyfriend is and she doesn't says anything. Then jessika comes and says
      that she's been too much. They tell her to go sweep the floor and she
      refuses. She tries telling herself that school is the only hell she needs
      to suffer. She just needs to get past this. They try taking her somewhere
      else but she refuses. This isn't liker her. Seems like the sleeping animal
      has woken. It has to be a mouse. Jessika holds her hair and thies holding
      her hair and stephine thinks that her enimy is hurting her life so she
      must protect and survibe in the intend to kill. Even if her enimy isn't
      trying to kill her. She holds her neck and chockes her and slams her head
      on the sharp side of the beanch and makes her bleed. Her classmates try to
      hurt her but seeing that they aren't invincible the sleeping monster
      rises. She must have the intend to kill. Must be ruthless to her enimies.
      She in an instance swips the enitre class who tried to oppose her and she
      tells herself that she is strong but an idiot. She felt like a worrior.
      But robert came. She tried fighting him but failed miserebely. She is
      scared but decided not to fall for dilutions again. She knows she can do
      it. She can win. Grey won against her. She won against them so he must
      have a weakness too. She knows. She isn't used to fighting. She stands up
      and tells herself that she must learn to grow and fight in order to rise
      up and reach that level of strength robert is since he reached it it isn't
      impoosible to reach.
      <br />
      <br />
      She tries her best but still fails. The teacher makes sure robert doesn't
      actually kills her. She came home with bandages. She wanted to talk to
      grey. Her mother said that he left with sota in the morning. Stephine
      calls sota and asks where they are. Turns out they are playing on the
      swing and playing with rope skipping. Stephine asked grey why he's always
      doing child things and grey tells her that it's in order to remember the
      child inside him. There is always a child inside them that seeks
      entertainment and it really feels like life is worth it when they do what
      they want to do. If they really try pretending to be mature and neglect
      their curiocity then are they adults or still child brain trying to
      pretend adult. Grey asks what she came here for. She tells grey that she
      fought her bullies and came in a winning position. Grey thinks of chess.
      But she had no chance when robert came to beat her. Grey tells her that
      she managed to kill it with the other opponents right. She says so. Sweet.
      So what she lacks right now isn't motivation for survibal, it's the
      experience and power. How'll she get those. By learning how to fight but
      grey recomends her to watch some action movies and she'll automatickly be
      motivated to fight. She asks for movie suggestions and grey says that
      let's forget it. She didn't smiled today. What's that for. Is there is a
      reason. Of course there is. She didn't do anything in order to smile. They
      need to constantly do something in order to somile. Normal people
      sorrunded by normal environment are cheerful cause of the people sorrunded
      by them but she's a sister and her brother is too young to match her
      mentality. So she doesn't know the right person to spend time with.
      <br />
      <br />
      That's fine cause all she needs to do is make a reason to smile. If there
      isn't then make a reason. Simple. Stephine asks what is it that she wants.
      Grey says no matter what it might be it isn't about her school bullys.
      Let's imagine her life if the school bullies. What is different about it.
      What? Nothing major. Just talking to some friends but no majour change.
      She's just as groomy and silent as always. That's why always happy people
      like grey makes themselves and others smile by making jokes or reason.
      It's impossible to find reason to smile so as he said sometimes they just
      need to create it. She thinks and says that she doesn't knows what she
      wants to do. She always liked to stay at her house cause she felt safe
      there. Grey told her that her house is like a castel to her. She needs to
      know that not every person is trying to kill her out there in the world.
      Grey asks for a walk. It's season of dead leaves. Grey tells stephine to
      find at least 10 leaves that crunch when she step on it. Grey does and he
      has already found 3. Sota has found 5. Stephine tries and as they walk a
      lot stephine was finally smiling when she found a leaf crunched when she
      stepped on it. Grey said he has his ten. Looks like he beat her again. She
      doesn't want to give up and manages to make ten leaves crunch. This made
      her smile and grey says that they should go back to her little doremetory.
      Sota saw that stephine smiled and grey didn't said anything about it.
      Stephine noticed that she smiled automatickly. Grey says that it's just a
      fluke. Fasination after reaching her goal. She still has yet to find true
      hapiness. They go home and grey asks her if she ever cooked anything.
      <br />
      <br />
      She said no and grye told her mother that they are the one's who are
      goanna do the cooking. She can focous on sota's studies today since he's
      been enjoying too much lately. Let the kid suffer from studies. Know the
      wrath of knoledge. Sota was angry but her mother understood that grey just
      wants to be alone with stephine. Grey teaches her how to cook rice. Then
      tells her exactly how to do things and she messes some stuff up and she
      finally managed to cook and when her father came and at her cooking and
      said it was delicious she smiled. Sota asked if that counts as a smile.
      Grey wonderes and says he doesn't knows. Was she happy to hear a
      compiment. She says she was. Grey then eats the food and thinks. It's
      certanily not bad. Stephine says that if it is bad then it has to be
      grey's fault cause he's the one who taugh grey how to cook. Grey didn't
      responce and after a few seconds he asked her if that was an insult or she
      tried to make a joke. She said joke. Grey said that her tone of talking
      isn't funny. Maybe she isn't meant for joking. She says that's so not
      true. Grey asks her where did the energy go. She then says it again with
      energy. Grey says that's how she should talk. She has energy but being
      truamatized took her body in low battery mode even though it's on 100%
      charge. She has energy so use it. Burn calory and everything. Grey stands
      up and stands on his chair and tells stephine that she needs to learn to
      cut her embaresement too. She needs to learn how to do emarresing work
      sometimes cause these are the little wholesome things that are importatnt.
      Stephine stands up on her chair.
      <br />
      <br />
      Sota does too. Her father does too. Seeing this her mother also stands on
      chair and stephine finally started laughing and everyone else started
      laughing. Stephine told they should eat their food since it's getting
      cold. Sota says that they are like a family. Stephine get's emabarassed
      and tells sota not to say stuff like that and grey asks why isn't a friend
      part of the family. Of course every friend is part of the family. Another
      3 to grey's collection. Today while sleeping stephine's father couldn't
      sleep. Since he was too happy. He thought that if he could he would have
      married grey to his daughter right here right now. Her mother asks why
      they don't ask grey and her father says that grey is a kind guy and doing
      everything due to the pureness of his heart. He never had any intentions
      with stephine to begin with. Who knows if he already has a love intrest.
      Her mother says that even sota likes him. They should do something about
      it. Her father says that he didn't managed to fuilfill his daughter's
      wants but he'll try his best to figure out a way to make it happen. In the
      morning when grey woke up sota asked grey if he has a girlfriend or not
      and grey asks where did stephine go. She went to school today. Grey asks
      where did this came from. Sota says that grey is so cool then he must have
      at least 3 girlfriends. Grey says that he has none. Sota asks if he has a
      crush on anyone. Grey thinks and says it wouldn't even matter if he had a
      real crush but sadly no. He doens't have any crush on anyone. Apperently
      he's labeled a looser in socity. That's why he probapally will never have
      a girlfiriend. Sota says that's so not true. Grey says that he accepts
      that if he dated then he would have surely found a girlfriend but he has a
      fear.
      <br />

      Fear of security. He has fear of break up that's why never got the courage
      to find a lover. He doesn't cares. If he lives long enough to see the day
      of his marrage then he'll definetely do arrange marrage with someone his
      father selects. Sota asks why not mom or his sister. He has a sister
      right. Grey says he does. And he thinks and says that he isn't intrested
      on his mother's liking and his sister is a different type of person. Sota
      asks what type and grey says that's definetely horny. That's what kind of
      person she seems to be in grey's eyes. Always saying something stupid
      making grey think that she flurts with anyone. Sota asks how old is his
      sister and grey says she weights right about 80 kilo potato bags and about
      as old as his grandma. Sota didn't thought someone could be that old. Grey
      went to brush his teeth. He didn't brushed for 3 days. On this side sota
      told everything to his father. He was excited to know that his father is
      planning marrage between grey and stephine. Sota likes grey. When stephine
      went to school she was feared by her classmates and jessika shamelessly
      came to hurt her but she didn't let her lay a finger on her. She has been
      afraid of robert and his men. They are strong and together they might pose
      a threat to her. She needs to prepare something for her own. Like a knife.
      Robert came school and saw stephine and told stephine that she didn't
      brought her boyfriend to them. She'll regret this. She thinks and bites
      her lips and says that she did what she didn't wanted to regret. Robert
      slaps stephine and leaves. She comes home and sees that grey isn't there.
      She asks her mother and she tells her that he went back to his apartment
      with sota.
      <br />
      <br />
      Stephine went there and she was shocked. Grey's room was super cleaned yet
      he was sleeping while sota was playing games on the tv. Grey spend the
      entire day with sota to clean the room cause he usually only cleans the
      house once a month. Stephine sleeps next to grey and looks at his eyes and
      grey looks at the ceeling and says that he doesn't needs to clean the
      ceeling fan. Does he. Stephine says they can do it together. Grey does so
      and they clean everything else. Grey asks if stephine likes kids and she
      says that she finds them cute. Grey asks if she likes animals. She says
      the same answer and grey thinks. He tells stephine that he might not be
      able to find a kid but he can show her animals. Stephine looked at sota.
      Grey says goatta say your humer is getting good. They decided to go to pet
      shop. They played with cute pets and they then went to an aquariam. Grey
      was the only one who got out bored insted of having fun. They were then
      ambushed by robert and his two men. They beat up grey and grey eneded up
      laughing. He told robert that he knows that he can beat him up right now
      even kill him but he doesn't cares right now. He can do the same to him
      but he won't do. He won't fight cause he knows that he is better than him
      and he doesn't want to make enimies anymore. The video was to let the
      world know what kind of misshappen is happening in his school that he once
      was in. If he really targeted him then he would be in jail right now.
      Robert laughed and said grey is thinking too far for which he's an idiot.
      Grey thinks and says he is an idito but he also is right based on his own
      way of thinking. Grey then tells robert to stop doing whatever he's doing
      with stephine. She isn't his personal pet. She has a life of her own.
      Right now if robert makes grey his friend he'll give up his life to
      protect him but he refueses to eloborate he'll make another enimy in the
      roster. Is that what he wants. Robert is confused.
      <br />
      <br />
      He came to beat this guy up and he's offering friendship. He thinks and
      says that he's willing to accept his proposal. He'll stop being his enimy
      and stop bothering stephine but for that he'll need to fight all four of
      his men and he himself in a 1 to 1 fight and if he looses even one their
      deal is broke. Grey accepts. Robert asks if he's really that confident
      he'll be able to fight all of his men and beat them up. Grey said that he
      got his own friends. Robert asks if he can really trust someone weaker
      than him. Grey says that his friends may be weak but not weaker than him
      or robert. Grey left and returned to stephine's home. He got bandaged on
      the head cause they hit him on the head hard. Stephine's father apologises
      to grey for doing this much to stephine and grey says that he's glad he's
      able to help someone. That's all his consern. He then tells them about
      what the deal was. Her fatehr was extreamly happy about it since finally
      things are fallin in a corner. Grey says but there is a problem. Grey
      wants stephine to fight and win one of the fights. Her father was worried.
      Grey said that he has his own reasons for this. Grey says that he will
      reject the deal if she refuses to fight. Her father doesn't knows why grey
      is so hard about this sitaution but if that's what he wants he can't
      elaborate since it must be for her own good. Her father looks at her and
      asks her if she's willing to fight and she says that she has no other
      option but she wants to fight the weakest one. Grey says that's no
      problem. How about they do some basic training. The next day stephine came
      to punch grey but failed to do so several times. She was exhusted. Grey
      told her to be faster. Fight with the intention to kill and she says she
      can't do it.
      <br />
      <br />
      For some reason she doesn't feels like that when she's with grey. Grey
      thinks and askes one of his female friends to come. She's a strong
      fighter. Grey asks her to beat up stephine and she'll try to fight back.
      She was confused but she thinks that she's trying to fight her bully. She
      accepts and they fight. Stephine try her best and get's a good edge but
      turns out the match was in her own hands all along. Stephine lost. Grey
      thought that she is strong but since she's a cowerd she is failing to
      utilize her ability to the fullest. Grey can't hope to teach her tehinicks
      right now cause learning thechnicks takes months and you'll forget your
      original fighting style that you were good at. But when you get good at
      your thechnicks then it'll be even better than your original power. Right
      now that's not an option. She needs to perfect her non technick fighting
      style and gain more speed cause she certainly doesn't lacks power. She got
      into 5 rounds with that female fighter and she learned some blocking
      technicks while fighting. Grey saw that and thought that she is learning
      but that can't be compared with the experience her opponennt has so she
      lost again. Her spirit isn't down cause she is strong and she experienced
      fight already and is sure that she can beat them if she becomes a little
      strong. Grey hears that and wonderes. He asks stephine to fight him and
      she does so but she is hasitating and not winning at all. Grey understands
      her problem. She is not showing the same speed while fighting him. Grey
      tells stephine that she doesn't needs any more training. She says what
      else is she supposed to do the rest of the week.
      <br />
      <br />
      Grey tells her that it's usesless for her to get any stronger cause the
      problem isn't her strength. It's her hasitence. She's hasitating cause she
      isn't sure about her own abilities. She doesn't trust her own self and
      grey was a bit stupid to think she can run a marathone who is scared of
      walking. Stephine says otherwise. She's been a lot confident since
      everything and is willing take this step. Grey thinks that it's good to
      see she is speaking her mind. Grey thinks and tells her that this is
      useless for her to train strength so he tells stephine that untill the
      next 7 days she'll live with grey and try her best to hit him as hard as
      she can starting from now. Grey woke up from sleeping and stephine tried
      hitting him but he doghed it. She tried hitting him while eating but he
      doghed it. Her father was wondering if grey was training her to be a ninja
      or something. Grey was teaching sota and stephine tried hitting him using
      pillow but failed miserebely. When he got out of shower she tried hitting
      him. They went outside and she tried hitting and got hit insted. At night
      she tried making grey slip but failed and at night she was awake to do
      something after grey sleeps but her phone vibrates. Grey and sota laughs.
      Grey says that that knife app wasn't so useless after all. Stephine came
      down trying to hit both of them in a fun way. She fell on grey's body and
      decided to hug him insted of leaving. She was feeling wierdly about grey
      and grey asked her if she forgot to move too along with speak.
      <br />
      <br />
      She hugs grey insted of leaving and grey wondered what was that and he
      decided to go along with it and stephine hit grey and said I did. Grey
      said that he didn't even felt it. She tried hitting grey again but grey
      threw her in such a way and holded her neck ready to snap it and said that
      100 wins and zero losses. How can she preetnd to win by such nasty
      tactics. Is she accepting the aligations she got when she was being
      bullied. Stephine get's angry and uses her legs as a way to get grey off
      the grip. Then she emmobolized him. Grey said so she finally won.
      Congrats. Stephine was tired so she fell on grey's back and fell asleap
      and grey was in an uncomfortable situation. Sota decided to leave and grey
      said english or spanish. The next thing they know is grey is taking
      stephine somewhere with him. It's dead of night. Stephine said she didn't
      expected grey to turn sota down when he wanted to come so much. Grey told
      stephine that sota is too young and probapally won't be able to keep his
      eyes open Untill the night. Grey reaches the spot. He booked this car for
      them. They are having a picnic at dead of night for some reason. Stephine
      and grey enjoys the night and sees the stars. They are finding shapes on
      the sky falling on the ground. Stephine tells grey that it feels like a
      date. Grey thinks and says that's not too different from a date other than
      them not being lovers. Grey asked stephine if she's being sleepy and she
      says a bit. Grey asks her to tell scary story and they ended up laughing
      since it wasn't scary at all. Grey tells her to keep her eyes open. She
      tells grey to hold her and grey felt a bit uncomfortable be he holded her
      while she was laying on her side. She was about to say something but grey
      stands up. He looks at the sky and stephine looks too.
      <br />
      <br />
      The sky looks extreamly beautiful when the sun rises and it's an heavenly
      feeling when the sun finally rose after 8 minutes. Grey tells stephine
      that he came to this exact place 8 years ago with his parents and that day
      when thought one thing. There was once a idiot who said why are you so
      sad. Life is so beautiful. That's like littelery saying why do you have
      asma there is so much air. Stephine laughs at that joke. Grey tells
      stephine that life is beautiful and just like a paitent she needs to
      inhale oxyzen like hapiness from the beauty of life that she can't see
      even though it's present. She needs to experience it. Stephine was about
      to say something to grey but decided to tell grey later that she loves
      him. She doesn't needs anything else. She knows for certain that she needs
      him. She doesn't need to have hundrens of hour of pleasure or doesn't even
      cares if she needs to spend hundreds of hours being bullied or in hell. As
      long is grey is there with her she's goanna be the happies person is
      existence. While walking home grey told stephine that she needs to know
      the magic of being a nice person cause she doesn't needs to be the master
      of psychology to make someone happy other than herself. Just say a nice
      compliment like hey you got a nice shirt or you look preety today miss.
      Maybe you are not making your own day but seeing someone else smile makes
      one really happy. Stephine thought about it and said not everybody falls
      under this and grey says that's true but she doesn't needs to make
      everyone smile. Just someone. Grey looks at a begger and tells her that
      she can make the begger happy by giving him some money for eating.
      <img src="images/2.avif" class="two" alt="" />
      <br />
      <br />
      He can make that lady happy by saying that she looks preety and make that
      man happy by saying that have a great day sir. Have a great day is a
      really important phrase that she should learn and make it her habit cause
      anybody she wishes have a great day is goanna make both of them feel
      better. Just try to say that to someone. She doesn't likes to talk to
      strangers but this task is a bit too much for her. Grey goes near that
      person and asked that person if he's going to office and that person says
      that yes he's going office. Grey says that office is a pain so he wishes
      him a good day. That man smiles and thanks grey and wishes same to him.
      Grey looks at stephine and tells her what she thinks and she understands
      what grey mean. Grey tells her to try say something similer to someone.
      She tries telling an old man similer but that old man thought else and
      shouted at her. Grey told her that there are people like them who are in
      tention or don't appreciate what other's do or say to them. Stephine
      thinks and grey tells her to try one more time. She didn't wanted to but
      grey forces her to do that and this time she got a good responce from a
      lady who's a mother of a child. She talks nicely towards that woman and
      that woman thanks her and leaves. Stephine smiled and she thanks grey.
      Grey then sees a scary black guy out there and asks her to talk to him.
      Stephine refuses cause he looks scary. Grey teaches her that looks can be
      decetive and goes and talks nicely to that guy. Hey bro what are you
      doing. That guy looked at grey and said he's waiting for bus. Grey says
      bus is late hugh? He says yes 30 minutes late. Grey says is he going
      somewhere. He says yes he has a flight to his france today. Grey says if
      he's goanna visit the ifel tower and he says no. He lives there. Grey says
      that his shirt looks nice. Where did he bought it from. He thanks grey for
      that and says he bought it online. Grey says that's great. Bus must be
      late but he wishes him a great day.
      <br />
      <br />

      Grey smiles and that guy also smiles and tells grey that he also wishes
      him a good day. Grey leaves and asks stephine what she thinks about that.
      She was confused. She didn't knew a guy who was so angry at the start can
      be so cheerful. Grey says that the world is a cruel place where you won't
      have hapiness. You need to find it yourself. And in such place when
      someone is kind enough to say have a great day seems happy. Cause these
      are the little things they should appereciate in life. They may sound
      basic but they are the most important acording to grey. Ofcourse grey
      doesn't goes around his way always telling people to have a great day but
      when he talks to someone or he feels like someone needs to hear that he'll
      say it to them. A word that someone needs to hear. Stephine remembers that
      she once saw a old man who was like grey descibes. Grey says that one old
      dude who treats everyone kindly like some store seller or something.
      Stephine says yes. They are the best. Those old people always smile when
      talking to someone and talk with a laugh. Just hearing them laugh makes
      grey's heart warm. Stephine agrees. And says she also likes when grey
      laughs. Grey says that he's glad to make her happy. Grey tells her to
      remember the three magical word. Thank you. Sorry and please. Have a great
      day has it's own layer. Stephine returned home and she was really
      cheerful. She thanks her mother for everything she has done for her and
      also her father too. She also thanks sota for everything. Her father asks
      where grey is and she says that he went home cause he was feeling sleepy.
      They didn't slept whole night and watched the stars.
      <br />
      <br />
      The situation itself wasn't so amazing but grey's words and way of
      thinking really made the entire situation really fun. Her father was happy
      about her and she was hasitant but she told her father that she is in love
      with grey. Her father says he too. She says that he might not understand
      what she is saying. Her father tells her that that's fine. He's fine with
      her desiccion. Matter of fact her parents were aready thinking about it
      since grey is a good kid. He thinks about talking to his parents. Turns
      out her mother already took their numbers from grey before hand. Her
      father decided to make a call and stephine was too embarresed to hear
      anything. She went to her room and rolled over taking a pillow. She wants
      to tell grey that she loves him already but she wants to wait. Who knows
      grey's preparing some short of surprise to him. Her father talked to
      grey's father and her father steven asked grey's father about grey and
      said he's greatufl to grey for this taht. He's great and he wants him to
      marry his daughter. He didn't sounded cheerful and said that wouldn't be a
      problem but he needs to hear grey's opinion about this. Her father asks if
      they'll meet and grey's father says that's probapally not an option cause
      he won't be able to visit that place in any time soon. Seems like steven
      is in some short of hurry. If they want they can do the marrage on grey's
      approval. Sadly they won't be able to be there. Steven says they are not
      in a hurry and they certainly don't wanna do anything without them. They
      can wait as much they want to make it happen. <br />
      <br />
      And also grey's father being his father must have a opinion about who the
      girl and how she is. What kind of personality she holds. Does she cook or
      not. Grey's father responds saying as long as grey is ok with everything
      he doesn't needs to interfear since he trusts his son's intuation. Her
      father wishes him a good time. They end the call. Seems like they are
      agreeing. Stephine's father was a bit confused though. Why did grey's
      father sounded so rough. He thought that his father must be the reason
      grey was such way. Too unemotianal causing grey to learn to do everything
      as he wants. On this side grey was sleeping while that exact girl that
      came to help stephine practise fighting was patting grey's hair. She likes
      his hair. Arvin and griffin and ali was also there. They wondered what to
      do since grey challenged such thing without their will and grey said that
      he would have won without their help but wants their help to let stephine
      know that there are more people out there in the world that are willing to
      help her and be her friend. Grey tells griffin to makesure she's
      comfortable to be around him and ask him for help when grey isn't around.
      That girl name aksha tells grey that he's acting like a true shimp. Grey
      says that he just wants to makesure she has a proper friend group. In the
      next remaining few days grey wants her to be familier with at least one
      friend group that she's comfortable with. Arvin says he's like doing too
      much for a friend. Does he like her. Grey says yes right in front of his
      moute. Everyone makes such noice and asks grey when he's goanna propose
      her and grey thinks and says never. He's never goanna propose to her or
      let her know that he even had a feeling for her. Not even for a single
      second. Ali says he'll be heartless then.
      <br />
      <br />
      Even she might like him and grey says they can remove this topic cause
      grey doesen't want to discuess this topic. Ali tells grey to tell her that
      he likes her even if she rejects. He's the one who said he doesn't want to
      live with regrets. Grey says that he knows what her answer will be. It's
      100% yes but that's the problem. If she's getting cured for grey's
      existence insted of his methods then grey is a falure at what he went for
      and he caused a huge loss for steven. Akasha asks why grey asked her to
      come. It's a fight between boys right. On top of that he's planning to
      drag stephine too in that path. Grey says that jessika is 100% in the
      fight. Grey knows how those idiots thinks and understands their value of
      stategy. He's sure he'll bring jessika, a black strong guy and two other
      strong guys that isn't from his feared 4 men. Ali asks why grey thinks
      that and grye says that it isn't like he hasen't rechered robert's history
      and his friend group. He has rechered everything from socialmeadia to
      romours to everything and understands that the most feared isn't always
      the most strongest. The most bravest is not always the lion. Anyways,
      what's in for lunch. It's just 10 am. They can still techinically eat
      breakfast. A day pass by and stephine didn't got a call from grey. She was
      worried about it. She wants to see him as soon as she can. Maybe a hug
      won't be bad for starter. Maybe later they can go into deep stuff.
      Stephine saw the blanket grey was wearing and took it and tried smeeling
      it. She likes his smell. On this side stephine was asked to come to a pool
      party.
      <br />
      <br />
      She wondered what to wear for that. She took a wierd dress in case they
      were alone. Who knows grey is goanna try teaching her something in the
      name of pool alone. Who knows if he's goanna touch her in the name of
      pool. She was extreamly wrong. It was a private pool that everyone seem to
      be enjoying. Stephine asked grey if it's part of her therepy or something.
      Grey says no. It's plain party. She didn't knew why she expected so much.
      They have fun in the party. They eat good food and try balencing
      themselves in a rope. The winner will get something secret price. The box
      is really big. Stephine failed it no matter how many times she tried. Grey
      then came and managed to do it on first try. As per the rules he will get
      a grand price. There is box in box in box in box in box in box. In which
      has a single onion. Considering the rising price of onions it's the grand
      price. Grey thinks and asks arvin if he has a new girfriend and he says
      no. Grey thinks and goes back to somewhere and brings a neckless made out
      of litteler 24 carrots and tells arvin to give it to his ex. The joke is
      overused but the fact grey littelery brought it into a party for a joke
      he's a genious. They then played water ballon fight which was great and
      everyone seems to be enujoying themselves. Grey became the target of
      everyone since he didn't got wet today. Grey doesn't want to get wet. Even
      stephine tries to make him wet throw throwing ballons at him but he doghes
      everything and manages to do everything so perfectly. At a final try
      stephine tried to throw grey at the pool along with herself which grey
      lets and she ends up laughing along with everyone. Everyone lands on the
      water and stephine made a lot of friends and took it on her contacts.
      <br />
      <br />
      The day ends and she was going home and grey said seems like they are
      splitting ways. See you later then. She stopps grey and tells him that she
      wishes to take him home. Grey says that he has work at home. Stephine says
      he can do that later. Grey tells her that she's not goanna be able to make
      him come today. Na uh. She tries her best but she isn't goanna be able to
      bring him to her home. Grey wins but stephine isn't goanna let go. She
      hugs grey and grey felt a little wierd senciation. Grey got serious and
      stopped laughing. He told her to stop and let him go in a serious way.
      Grey used strength to loose her grip and she looks at his eyes. Grey has a
      serious dead eyes. Grey says let me go. Stephine says she'll do anything
      to make him stay. Grey says she isn't god. She can't make him always stay.
      Sometimes she'll need to learn to let go. Grey looses the grip and leaves
      stephine. He didn't even looked back at her. It made her cry a bit. She
      was really sad when she returned home. She didn't talked to anyone. Her
      father asked her what happend and she didn't said anything. She said
      nothing. Her father was worried and asked her what happend. Sometimes
      she'll have things she doesn't want to share cause her father might not
      understand but she can try telling him. He may not undersatnd it but she
      can blame him later saying he doesn't understand me. Stephine tells her
      father that she asked grey to come home and tried holding him tightly. He
      refused. He said she's goanna have to learn how to let go. What did he
      mean by that. Is he not goanna come over anymore.
      <br />
      <br />
      Her father says it must be wierd for grey to come over so many times. They
      only met a week or so ago. Must be 10 days or so. Stephine says she looked
      into his eyes. It was scary as if he was trying to tell her that her good
      days are over. She now must prepare to be hunted. Her father says grey
      must be angry cause of her insistency. He doesn't hates her. Her father
      hugged her and went back to his room. She couldn't sleep properly that
      day. The next day when stephine called grey he didn't responded. He
      messeged her that todays' task is her to at least make 3 good friends in
      the last remaining 3 days. good luck. She wanted to messege that it
      doesn't sound like a good idea but grey went offline. She won't meet grey
      this last three days before the thing happens? That's extreamly cruel for
      grey to teach how to let go. Stephine decided to talk to akasha and talked
      with her and didn't felt easy. Akasha noticed it and said she doesn't
      needs to force herself into talking. They can just hand out and stay quiet
      most of the time. She didn't knew that was also possible and she did. Now
      she started to feel bad cause she feels like she's making her feel bored.
      Akasah was at her house on bed using her phone. She tells stephine that
      she isn't bored. Sometimes friends just want to be next to eachother to
      spend time. That's what they enjoy. She can use her phone alone but when
      she finds a cool photo and has no one at her age to share it right now to
      get reaction. that's the sad part. Stphine undersatnds and tries finding
      something cool and she didn't got the reaction she wanted but she did
      realized that she was happy cause of it. She then went to arvin's house
      and he was a wierd guy who had different personality and everything that
      potrayed him as a looser. She then went to griffin's place and she felt
      wierd reading books with him. He's like the topper of the class but she
      also learned some new stuff with him.
      <br />
      <br />

      She then went to ali's house. He has a built in gym in his house but he's
      still fat. That's ironic. She then went to some other friend's house and
      stephine realized that one thing was common among grey's friend. None of
      them complained when stephine asked if she can stay there a night. They
      were super polite and nice people. How did grey select such friends. How
      did he select such nice people around him. What was the reason it seemed
      so perfect. Everyone had the same answer. They just liked eachother by
      their way of talking. Talking is so important in social life. That people
      hate or like or give you a second chance or make you your enimy. That's
      what she learned that time. She went home and spend the last 2 days home
      alone. Her father was worried. She was happy when grey was near her and
      now she's returning to her previous state. Steven remembers what grey told
      him. He finally realized that he may have made a mistake by making grey do
      all the work. Now she's feeling lonely. But once they get married and get
      rid of robert then they won't have any problem. Right? Steven thought
      twise and thought that grey already made stephine realize that robert
      wasn't her problem in life so what will she do if grey rejects her. He
      never had any intention with her anyways. He has no idea what he'll do
      when grey does so cause stephine certainly seems to be only happy when
      he's around. It's definetely not obsession or is it. The next thing that
      is the day comes. Stephine reaches the place. It's the fighting day.
      Robert asks where grey is and no one has any answer. Arvin, ali, griffin,
      akasha and stephine are only ones who are present there. Griffin goes
      first. and fights one strong guy. He was strong but he managed fight with
      hand to hand. Then comes akasah who fought jessika just as grey guessed.
      <br />
      <br />
      This time another one of robert's ghoun came and arvin took care of him
      using his kicks. Then came the black guy who was really strong. Probapally
      stronger than robert. Stephine said she wants to take the weakes guy not
      the strongest one. Grey came in time and fought that guy off. He won. Then
      came robert vs stephine that she understands why grey made her fight him
      cause she needs to fight her own enimy. No one will stand for her in the
      world. Maybe some will protect her but it'll be worthless if she doesn't
      knows how to protect herself. She fights robert and uses grey's
      thechinicks to take advantage of robert's clumshymovements and took him
      down but she didn't wanted to finish this off such way. She gave robert a
      second chance. Robert asked why she did such thing and stephine says that
      she isn't like him. She knows that she hates him and wants to kill him if
      possible but she won't cause she's not him and she'll never be him. After
      hearing this for the second time robert got angry and decided to leave. He
      definetely didn't wanted to be insulted by a woman. She won. Everyone was
      happy. They threw a party containing aria too. Stephine was happy. She
      never imagined such day would come to her life. She never thought that her
      bully would stop with their own free will. But she definetely feels like
      she earned it. She smiles throw the entire day and was really happy. On
      her way home she wanted to tell grey that she is in love with him but she
      thought that grey might get angry at her again so she tells grey that she
      wants to meet grey tomorrow. Grey says why. Stephine asks why grey doesn't
      wants to meet her anymore.
      <br />
      <br />
      Grey tells her that she should learn one thing from now that grey isn't
      someone reserved for her own. He has a life of his own and ofcourse he can
      meet her whenever she wants since they are friends but this everyday
      metting and spending time is a bit wierd to grey. But he did as much as he
      can even though it was embarrasing and boring to him to makesure he
      fuilfills that one promice he made to her father. It might sound bad to
      her but grey doesn't want to spend time with her. This breaks her heart.
      She starts crying. She says- But I love you. Grey says that he knows. He
      heard from his father. Her father talked to his father about it. Grey
      sadly has to tell her that grey doesn't loves her. Stephine says that has
      to be a lie. Grey says that it isn't a lie and she can't change facts. She
      was about to say why and grey told her not to say why. Cause grey already
      had told her and her father that he didn't wanted any of this. He wanted
      her fahter to do all those to makesure she doesn't feels lonely when grey
      leaves her but they are the ones who insisted. She can't say that why you
      did all those for her when he didn't loved her. He cares for perople
      doesn't mean he has to love them. Of course he loves stephine but that is
      limited to a friend. Not anything too close. Stephine asks if grey is
      kidding and it's part of his plan to teach her how to give up. Grey says
      no. and yes together. She doesn't understands. Grey says no cause he's
      serious. He can't start a relation with her and yes cause it's true. He
      had plans for how he can cheer her up. An entire list but the moment he
      heard from his father what her father did he burned that list.
      <br />
      <br />
      Stephine asks why and asks grey what's wrong with her. Grey says that he
      doesn't likes obessive relations that stephine wants to have. He has his
      own reasons that's why he refuses to start a relation with her. Stephine
      asked him what is wrong with her. She can change. Grey says that he
      doesn't wants her. Can she change that. She says no and grey tells her
      that he hopes she'll find her own way of hapiness. Cause hapiness is not a
      person. Never has been. Cause people leave. And never come but they are
      the ones who stay to themselves. She should learn to love the little voice
      in her head more than a hollow manifastation of her needs. Grey leaves and
      stephine was extreamly sad. She stopped talking again. She hates herself.
      She thinks that grey hates her cause she's not good enough for her. She's
      a looser. And she hates that. She wished she was someone else. Her father
      was worried about her and didn't knew what to do. Hearing such even sota
      got worried. He went to grey's house. Grey welcomed sota and asked him the
      reason for his arrival. They played games together. Sota asks why he
      doesn't likes his sister and grey says that she's being overly obsessibe
      it makes him feel uncomfortable. Sota said he didn't thought grey would
      come back to play games with him and grey told sota that he has no problem
      talking and playing games with him. He can come visit his house anytime.
      <br />
      <br />
      Even stephine can but he won't be able to accept their obseesibe one sided
      relation. Sota was worried about his sister. Grey told sota that it's what
      she'll do. If he did had relation with her then he'll need to leave at one
      point due to the obsessibe relation. What then. She's so sad right after
      such a short interaction then what would she do when grey does so. Won't
      she suicide? That's what grey's consern is. Sota asks why grey needs to
      leave her and grey explains something and sota was extreamly shocked. When
      he returned home he told his parents not to be saden by grey's absence. It
      was for the better that she didn't got into that relation. Her father asks
      why that is and sota says that grey isn't a sane person. That's all he has
      to say. Sota tells his father that he saw something extreamly disturbing
      thing about grey that even he's aware of. He doesn't want to let stephine
      be ruined cause he no matter what kind of bad habit he may have he's still
      a kind soul. Steven was really confused. He wanted to know what was that
      badhabit that sota speak of. Sota says that he refuses to say it on words
      on bring it on his moute. Steven sees no way. Stephine is in love and he
      can't change that fact. Maybe he should have done those things grey did
      himself but what would it have changed. In the end it's just fatherly love
      he will be showing. He can't hope his daughter to find hapiness from him
      alone. She had to find someone loving and she did. Now what is wrong with
      grey. If there is really something wrong with grey then he needs to find
      it out to let his daughter know.
      <br />
      <br />
      Steven now has a mission to find out what is wrong with grey. On this side
      grey was drinking something and turns out it was alchahol. this isn't
      grape juice he ordered. Griffin says that he ordered it. Grey said that
      alchahol isn't halal on top of that... Wait both of them are already 18.
      Griffin said that he noticed this now. Grey forgot that he had his
      birthday 3 days ago. Griffin said he didn't forget. Grey says he's still
      not 18. Griffin says just a week is left and grey doesn't listens. He
      tells the waited to take the drink back. He won't let him drink. Grey
      thiks about life and how fast time passes by. Griffin asked that there is
      still more to it. More suffering and everything. Griffin said he did too
      much for stephine and now he's leaving her. He's wierd. Grey said he has
      his own prefers and on top of everything he'll ruin her with his bad
      habits. Griffin says him to enjoy and leaves. Grey went home. He looked at
      the ceeling and thought to himself what to do. Nothing is on mind. He
      remembers that he used to be a genious at everything that's why he was
      bored but he once saw a joker he met and that guy made everyone happy.
      Grey wanted to be that guy so he started joking around and making himself
      sad in the process. What did he achieve from other peopl's smile now that
      this is where his life has came to be. Some say that people who smile all
      the time aren't always happy. That's true. People aren't always happy but
      grey wishes to do anything for other's hapiness and also he doesn't want
      to be the reason for someone else's sadness. Grey remembers that once he
      hurt a kid with too much power that he started crying.
      <br />
      <br />
      It was physically bad for that kid but it was mentally more ruining to
      grey. Since that day grey forgot what hapiness was until he came back to
      his home town and looked back into his childhood cartoons. His life
      flashed throw his eyes and it was like he discovered a huge treasure. He
      discovered the reason for hapiness and started wishing everyone a good
      day. Have a great day is a phrase he tells everyone but who has told this
      to him till this day? No one. Everyone says thanks you too. But who wishes
      him are you ok. Are you happy. I hope you are doing well. No one asked
      him. That's the question. Why does no one ask. Do they not care for him.
      He thinks to himself that those doubts are stupid cause he knows people
      have their own life and won't see any problem unless he shows them. That's
      how his judgement kills his doubts but it leaves him hollow from inside
      cause he answered his questions but who'll give him the proof. Who'll give
      him the gurentee that he's right. There is always a posibility that he's
      wrong and there is something wrong with him. That's the reason he doesn't
      knows what to do anymore. He never wanted anything to anyone and when he
      found someone who wanted many things from him he was happy to make someone
      happy who appreciated it throw not only thank you but love. Grey is truely
      unlucky. An entire week passes by and stephine is extreamly sick. She
      thinks she's goanna die. She cries everyday. She tells that she doesn't
      know how's she goanna live without grey. She didn't knew how she can fall
      in love with someone so quickly. But she knows that she needs grey no
      matter what.
      <br />
      <br />
      She can't feel happy no matter what if grey isn't there for him. He taught
      her how to live now she forgot how to live by herself. She's been sick for
      an enitre week now and her father is worried now. He is giving her
      medicine acording to doctor. She's barely getting good. The next day comes
      and stephine is a little better than yesterday. She went to school and she
      hates school. School never been so peaceful since she doesn't remembers.
      She thinks and sees that robert didn't came to school today. While she was
      walking one of them put their leg so stephine fell. She hit her head and
      started bleeding. She was on the ground. She saw other's laughing at her
      for falling. Some came to help but she had no reaction. It wasn't
      pethetic. It was as if she didn't cared. Stephine calls that guy out for
      making making her slip. That guy tells her that it was just an accident.
      Stephine decided something else. She kidnapped that guy and made his
      suffer so much that he begged for his life. She constantly threw his head
      in water and she remembers that he always used to throw stuff at her.
      Stephine takes a pot of hot water and throws it at him. Stephine comes
      home and her father asks her how school was today and she says that it was
      good. That's the only word she said in the past few days.
      <br />
      <br />
      The next day robert saw that one of his friends had burn on his face and
      he looked at stephine and said he just accidently fell and he had hot
      water on his hands. He was making noodls. Robert says he doesn't knows how
      to cook. That guy says that's exactly that happend. He's new so... Today
      jessika was looking at stephine badly so stephine decided to make a
      change. Everyone suddenly started looking at jessika cause her listick is
      turning blue and black. It drops like she drank blood. She was confused.
      What happend to her lipstic. She went to the bathroom and checked and
      realized that her expencive lipstic was too watery. Did water drop from
      her bottle to bag. How else did it happen? But her bag isn't wet. Maybe
      it's cause she always keeps her lipstik in her bag. Her lipstic suddenly
      started hurting. It burns. Stephine remembers how many times jessika threw
      her own lunch to stephine's face and everything. Stephine came and did the
      same but insted of lunch she threw mud at her face which had a lot of
      worms. She was disguisted and stephine smiled saying that it was a prank.
      Jessika said they had a deal and stephine said and she broke it. What is
      she goanna do? Fight her. She knows herself that she can't without robert.
      Stephine takes advantage of this situation and holds her hair in such a
      way that she used to hit her and jessika was hurt. Jessika suddenly went
      missing and stephine was asked about it. She asked how would she know
      about it and turns out she was locked at the bathroom with dirt on her
      body. She tried making noice but after a long time someone came to help
      her.
      <br />
      <br />
      Jessika was theretend by jessika that if she takes her name then she'll
      upload something so bad for her. It's her naked pictures along with
      bullied scean. And not only that she'll not stop bullying her both
      physically and mentally until the day she dies. She'll follow her to hell.
      Jessika was truamatized. She stopped coming to school. She changed
      schools. This made robert aware that something is going on. They can't do
      graduation properly? Robert tries bullying stephine by saying they had a
      deal. Stephine said that she is breaking it. She has to admit it. She
      liked the way he treated her before. Robert asked if she is horny and
      stephine says she definetely has lust for him. To make him suffer. Robert
      realizes that she's a psychopath. Robert tries running but he fails.
      Stephine cut's robert's head bald and then decided it wasn't enough. so
      she writes some stuff with knife on his face and tells him not to show his
      face in school ever again. Robert's father was furious and robert told his
      father not to act since she's a psychopath. If they act they can
      definetely kill her off but it'll be bad for their suspecion and
      everything. It's easy to figure out. They need to make sure that she's
      alive and breathing but not enough to say the same thing to him. On this
      side grey was alone wondering some short of zoo and was patting animals
      cause he likes animals. He was eating something when he saw the face of
      jessika there. she was wearing a mask. Grey noticed her and asked how she
      is been. She refuses to answer. Grey said he promiced to robert that
      they'll be friends if he stops bullying stephine. He doesn't want to be
      entire enimies and wants to treat her too as a friend. Jessika shows her
      face to grey and grey was shocked. This is what stephine did to her. Grey
      was furious to know why.
      <br />
      <br />
      Jessika said that she did it to her for no reason at all. She did
      something similer to robert and now he's bald. She said that she
      misunderstood her own feelings. She liked it when she got bullied. She
      just wants to make a single difference and that's she's the one who wants
      to do the bullying. Grey said this is bad. He calls stephine and she is
      now the one who doesn't answers the call. Grey tries calling sota and he's
      been blocked by them and now he thinks if he should call her father or
      not. He thinks and thinks no. He should wait. So he decided to meet her
      himself. On this side the next day comes and grey sees that stephe left
      home and went to school. From there she went to school with her following
      her. There from he decided to stay behind the school and found her
      wearbouts. She was truamatizing another one of her bulies. She's taking
      revenge. Stephine on this side was cornered by robert's group and was
      taken for her to be beat up but turns out she had a knife. She decided to
      kill robert but grey came to save him. Grey slapped stephine and told her
      that what is she doing. They had a deal. She's now missusing her freedom.
      Stephine says that she just wants revenge for them ruining her feelings
      and everything. Grey says that robert may have caused her a lot of
      problems but that doesn't mean she has any right at all to hurt him or
      kill him. Stephine says that he took away her hapiness. Grey hates her
      doesn't he cause she's a fucking nuicence. She's emotional and that's the
      reason grey hates her doesn't he. It's all his fault. Grey was confused.
      He asked if she was doing this for him and she says yes. Grey said he
      feels ashemded. Grey took robert and helped him walk home. Stephie went
      home and cried. Robert thanked grey for saving him and grey told robert
      that he gave him his word and he will never go against his words. Robert
      made grey his friend.
      <br />
      <br />
      Now he'll give up his life if he needs to protect robert and if he betrays
      him then...maybe he doesn't needs to think that far since that isn't
      happening. Robert tells grey it's better for him to think before and
      after. Who knows if stephine comes to kill him again. They leave laughing.
      On this side stephine is crying to her father. She's more sicker than
      ever. She feels like she's goanna die. Her heart beat is too high and
      blood preasure is too. Her father was too wooried for her that he decided
      to go to grey and beg him to come back. She's goanna die. Grey told her
      father what she did and her father says he doesn't know how he'll do
      anything at all as a father. He feels like a falure but he knows that grey
      can solve everything. He needs him. Grey tried thinking and told her
      father that it was a mistake for him to even consider that he has the
      ability to heal and her father tells grey that he's wrong. He changed her
      completely since the day he met her. And now she's too depended on him. He
      knows it's a bad thing but he can think the other way can't he. That
      grey's existence made a meaning in her life. Grey had no option but to
      return. He went to stephine and saw that her tempreature was so high and
      decided to stay the night there. On this side sota woke up and asked his
      father where his father went and he said he went to brought grey and sota
      asks if he came and her father says yes. Sota was surprised so he quickly
      went to check. Seems like grey also won sota's heart along with
      stephine's. This made steven confused. Sota said he doesn't want stephine
      to end up with grye cause he has a bad habit? He was lying? A kid at his
      age? For what reason? Stephine is returning to her normal tempreture but
      grey got her sickness from her this made her sad but grey told her that he
      ate a lot of ice creams which could be the reason behind his high
      tempreture.
      <br />
      <br />
      That's a clear lie. Stephine hugs grey and grey wonderes what to do now.
      He messed things up real bad. But I guess some things are better of...
      They start by watching childhood cartoons. Trying to make shadow pupets.
      Pupet shows with socks. Trying to light paper on fire using magnifying
      glass but stephine had a different idea. A camp fire but they need to
      light it up using magnifying glass. Grey sets up 4 of them and waits. They
      lit up and they officiallly started cooking. It was a picnic near a beach.
      Everyone was enjoying themselves and grey was feeling a bit off. They were
      playing with paper airplane and grey won but he was sad for some reason
      looking at the sea. They then make sand castal and break watermelon being
      blindfolded. They eat the watermelon and then are buried on sad. Grey was
      eating ice cream and stephine ate from his moute. This confused him a bit
      insted of flustered. At night they tells skary stories and grey was
      surprised by stephine's humer. At night stephine was having a nice time
      with grey playing pillow fight. Grey didn't slept. He was not feeling too
      good. He was awake the entire time and grey went to the toilet for many
      times. Does he have a bad stomach ache? Stephine went to check on grey but
      grey said he just have a bad health. He's taking a shower again. She was
      worried about grey. Turns out the entire bathroom is filled with blood.
      Grey is choughing. He wonders what to do. He can't let anyone find this
      out. On the next day arvin was trying to make a card house and grey saw
      him doing it. Grey insted of helping him decided to make a house of his
      own this made arvin furious and he finished his house already. Grey's card
      house was bigger.
      <br />
      <br />
      Grey thought that they can make the card house bigger so grey combines his
      and arvin's card house and finishes up a big card house but akasha ruined
      it. Grey was silent for a second. It was as if he was paralysed for a few
      seconds. He came back to reality. He started laughing and decided to make
      a mess of cards. This made grffin worried. Stephine was worried but she
      didn't realized anything at all. Stephine was cheerful the entire time.
      This vecation was worth the time. The next day they all ride boats and
      everything. They return after having a good time. On car arvin says that
      grey had a nice idea by having such event. It must have costed a lot. Grey
      says not much compared to what it was. Arvin told grey that he must pay
      him back as a friend and grey says he doesn't want to be paid back. Grey
      wasn't his usual self. He was talking like a robot. As if something was
      wrong. He was acting like a different. Person. Arvin said that he needs
      to. Grey suddenly freaks out. He shouts stop the car. He goes out of the
      car and coughs and throws out. Stephine asks grey that he's been acting
      strange since a few days. Grey says that his health isn't been all good
      lately. Feels so bad that he wished he was rather dead but he's suffering
      being alive. Sometimes being alive is so pain. Stephine get's angry and
      tells grey not to say such stuff and arvin says those shot of stuff is
      grey always says. He grew up hearing and saying those stuff. And on top of
      everything he always get's car sick. Stephine pats grey's head and grey
      thanks stephine for loving him. He never thought that this is what people
      feels when someone they love is near them. Certainly a new feeling. He
      still has a new experience. Stephine comforts grey and grey thinks he has
      no idea how'll long he'll keep going this on.
      <br />
      <br />
      His docotor told him that he's only goanna live two months max but his
      health is already getting worse. Just been a month and he doesn't knows
      how many days he has left. His doctor said he was doing better. He may
      have lived now a few more weeks than anticipated. And if they have hope he
      could have beaten cancer he has but seems like it has turned to zero. All
      hope is lost. He now doesn't knows what to do. He didn't wanted stephine
      to get in this relation cause he knows if she fell in love then she'll
      kill herself when grey leaves. She was already willing to after such a
      short interaction. He really hates himself for bringing her into such
      situation. What was he thinking. Showing kindness to a girl in such
      situation. He shouldn't even have had to open his moute. He wanted to
      spend his days alone in his apartment but he thought girls thought
      differently than boys. Falling in love with someone capable insted of
      someone intrested. That's what he thought but it was all wrong. All those
      rumours around the world he heard was wrong. He doesn't understands
      anything about them or at all. He wanted to die alone but now he's into
      spending time cause of stephine. He wished he could have avoided his
      parent's interaction and not let his mother specially know that he isn't
      goanna live much longer. But now he has someone else who can't be let
      known of his situation. If now grey were to die then he'd ruin some of his
      friend's feelings. A certain sadness that they'll have. He doesn't wants
      that. He starts smiling and tells everyone that he feels good enough. It
      was raining when grey returned home and he decided to spend time on his
      roof of house cause he likes rain and doesn't knows if he'll ever find the
      chance to see rain again.
      <br />
      <br />
      Stephine says that it's falling snow in syleth. So wierd. Global warming
      took a different pace now. Grey thought it was cool. He wants to visit
      that place since he has never seen snow fall in his life. stephine says
      she wants to go there with grey. She was standing while raining with grey.
      Grey said he isn't goanna go there alone with her. He's goanna bring his
      friends. Stephine tells grey that they also need to spend some time alone.
      And grey says that he just doens't feels like it. Stephine decided not to
      go against his will then. She tried making grey smile but he wasn't
      smiling for some reason. They hold eachother throw the rain. Stephine
      tells grey that they are goanna fall sick if they don't get inside. Grey
      tells stephine that he isn't sure. If he's in love with her really or is
      his emotions are mixed. This made stephine feels sad by this information.
      She tells grey that think of this like an arrange marrage. They are
      together at first for not disliking eachother but then soon they'll surely
      fall in love. Grey says he isn't sure about that. Stephine tells grey that
      she has no answer for his question cause she's too afraid that her answer
      might change her situation. She doesn't want grey asking anything similer
      any time soon anymore. Grey tells her sorry for asking such thing. Grey
      smiled and kissed her. They then rided on bike together and watched
      rainbow. Stephine wondered where it ended and they got lost while trying
      to explore the end of rainbow. They then see a video online where it
      clearly shows an ending to rainbow. Is it fake? no. The illusion is such
      way that it seems like so. They try cathing dragon flies. Playing with
      sticks like swords and sneaking snaks before dinner.
      <br />
      <br />
      Reading booring books Then jumping between buildings. It was fun. The day
      of going to snow was finally here. Just two days later. Arvin asked grey
      what was going on his head? He never did so much to go to different
      places. Grey said that he doesn't knows when will be the next time he'll
      be with them again since he'll be leaving this country and returning to
      his parents a few days later. This surprised everyone and griffin asked
      why and grey says that he came here for only a month or so but didn't
      expected to stay for so long. He decided to expand his holiday but can't
      do it anymore. Stephine asks if she can go with him cause she also wants
      to meet his parents and grey explains that he already bought the tickint.
      They can talk about this later. In mountain place they enjoy cosplaying as
      ghosts since it's an event going on there. Stephine rides horse in there
      and fells over the horse and she hit her face but insted of crying she
      laughs over her clumsyness and grey laughs too. They make a snow man and
      fight over snow. Grey made a cake for them and arvin took a photo but as
      soon as grey noticed it he decided to get out of the photo. They prank
      call in the night. They were all having a nice time but grey couldn't
      sleep. Stephine also couldn't without grey. Grey told stephine that she'll
      need to live without him for a while. Stephine says she'll wait for him.
      Forever. Grey says forever is a long time isn't it. Stephine says maybe
      not forever but yes if grey takes forever to return then she'll might as
      well wait that long if she needs to. The day ends and they all went home
      and grey saw them one by one leave. Grey thinks to himself that he'll
      never see them again in his life. Grey finally sleeps at home with
      stephine.
      <br />
      <br />
      Grey was sleeping in stephine's house. He sneaked out to grab something to
      eat but sota saw grey. He asked grey if his health is any good. Grey told
      sota to grow up to look after his sister. Steven was awake and was going
      to bathroom but when he heard the word health he stopped. Grey told sota
      that he only has a week or so to live. He didn't wished to spend so much
      time here and now he doesn't knows when he'll die. He doesn't knows if he
      dies people will forget him or saden them. He definetely doesn't wants
      that. He pats sota's head and tells sota to forget him when he dies. Cause
      he doesn't want his existence to impact him cause he'll be a dead man in a
      few days. Sota started crying. Grey's hands were shaking too much. He
      couldn't stop it and he was getting restless over it. He was sweating too
      much. Stephine was sound sleep thinking grey was beside her but she
      noticed that grey wasn't near. She went to see grey and saw that was
      standing with sota and grey told stephine that both of them sneaked out to
      eat something. Grey made a ring out of cardboard. Steven came out and said
      he heard some short of noice so he came too. Grey knew that steven heard
      them talk. Grey ate some stuff and stephine went to sleep with sota cause
      he wanted to sleep with her for some reason. Steven and his wife talked
      with grey and steven asked grey if that's the reason he rejected stephine
      earlier. Grey says yes. Steven was furious. How long does he knows about
      that. Grey says a few days before he met stephine. Steven says how can he
      smile like that after that. Grey says that somehow it works out cause
      people die and they'll so some day. Weather it is today or the day after.
      <br />
      <br />
      He can't let him bother him cause it was the only thing what can happen.
      Grey can't change his life and the outcome but he can indeed change what
      he lived with. That has to be without regret but he failed. He has
      regrets. He didn't inteded to spend so much time with his friends cause he
      knew that he'll get attached and knew that he didn't wanted to be
      stephine's boyfriend even though he liked him alright but he himself
      doesn't knows if it's love or true not. Grey had to spend all those time
      for her betterment. Now he's regretting everything. He had so much to do
      in life. So much to achieve. So many wishes stayed unfuilfilled. But even
      at such moment grey can't help but laugh at himself. He's pethetick isn't
      he. Seeing grey laugh made steven so sad that he apologised to grey. He
      made him do so much that he didn't cared for his feeling. Grey says that
      he did what he thought would be the best cause that's how people behave.
      They do what they think they do the best. Grey can't say he didn't have
      regrets but he can say right now that he has no regret right now and
      that's the main thing. Grey wishes that steven will find someone better
      for stephine once he leaves cause he isn't coming back. Grey goes to his
      room and this made steven cry and his wife also cried thinking about what
      will happen to stephine. Why did it had to be grey. Why couldn't someone
      else had to be this way. Steven can't express how greatful he is to grey
      but now this is such a situation. He's truely greatful towards grey.
      <br />
      <br />
      Stephine wakes up in the morning and no one is around her. Her phone is
      not at her right place. Did grey took it. She checks it and noticed that
      none of the photos that she took in the past few days was there.
      Everything was deleted. Who did it? Was it grey? If yes then why? She
      checked a letter type thing it was a photo of her sleeping nicely happy.
      Grey's face was ripped off of the photo. Stephine wondered why was that
      the case. On the back was written 'Don't forget this smile and Please
      forget my existence.' She was so sad that she didn't understood the
      meaning of such text. Sota was standing on the exit with the door opened.
      Stephine went to ask what he was doing and where is grey. Sota explains
      that he left. He isn't coming back. Stephine asks what is happeing. Why is
      this happening. Why? Why suddenly this. Everything was so perfect till
      yesterday. She started crying. She decided to run for grey without hearing
      a single thing. Her father tried stopping her. Sota told stephine what
      grey told him back that day. He said that he doesn't wants anyone to be
      impacted by his death which he can't avoide. Specially stephine. He wishes
      that people forget his existence cause that's the best thing to do after
      he dies. There won't be any meaning left for them to hold on to the past.
      Grey truely wishes that stephine hates him and his friends hate him. Only
      then they won't be sad when he dies. People will say that idiot died and
      laugh off it. Wouldn't that be the best thing he can wish for his own
      death? Stephine was snapped. She started crying saying that grey is a
      gerk.
      <br />
      <br />
      He didn't left a single photo behind. He knew it from the start. He knew
      it and yet he decided not to leave a single photo. That good for nothing
      skum. While stephine was crying. On this side grey wasn't feeling so good
      on car. He went out to sit. His flight will definetely be missed cause he
      went out to delet all his existence. He can't sit on car cause he's
      getting sick. He starts coughing blood. His driver is consern for grey
      since his condition is gettig worse. Steven was sitting on his chair while
      he saw stephine cry and he had nothing to do. Steven called the airport to
      check if grey reached there but he hear that grey didn't reached there. He
      was consern about it. He called grey and his phone rang. Someone picked
      up. It was the driver. He said grey's situation is getting worse than
      worse. He doesn't knows if he's goanna make it alive till an hour. So he
      asks him to come to meet him. Grey tells his driver to throw his phone
      away. He doesn't wants to meet anyone. Steven understands and tells sota
      stephine and his wife to hop on the car cause they are going to meet grey.
      While they were out Akasha was on the way. They picked her up and they
      rushed to grey's location. They reached there and they didn't made it in
      time. He was already dead. Steven couldn't believe his eyes. That guy who
      always smiled was in such situation. He holded grey and tried telling him
      say that he'll be better soon but started crying himself and stephine took
      over and hugged grye and started crying on the road. On this side griffin
      was called by akasha to tell the news and he broke the family table that
      had the food in it. Griffin was an extreamly good guy but he did such
      thing. He rushed to grey's location and arvin did as well as ali and a lot
      of other people.
      <br />
      <br />
      Robert was also among those people. Stephine's father called grey's father
      and his father told steven to take charge for his burial. Steven asked if
      he knew about grye's situationa and when he said yes steven asked it must
      be really hard for him to accept his son's condition. Grey's father tells
      steven that to be hones he's glad for everything. He lived his entire life
      throw success and he earned everything but grey was his exact opposide. He
      was childish and always happy for no reason. But later he realized that he
      was not always happy. He made himself happy cause he was smart enough to
      understand that he can't be always happy in life. And when he heard his
      son say that he doesn't want the world to remember him and forget him
      cause his death won't impact anyone other than mentally. He thought
      himself that he was too crazy but his mind was so filled with joy. He
      never felt so proud. He had to respect his decission cause he knew that
      grey was not just a normal kid. He had adult thinking since he was young.
      So it would make sence if he also treated him like a another man. He's
      glad that grey could make his daughter happy even if it was for a bit.
      Steven says that he ows too much to grey yet he gave everyone everything
      he had to offer yet he left with nothing. Death is sad. Steven then takes
      care of the funerwell and proper burial. Arvin hear what grey had to say
      about his life from sota and arvin wasn't sure what to do. Griffin says
      that he was an idiot. He won't listen to what an idiot has to offer. He
      will remember him even if it's meaningless tohim.
      <br />
      <br />
      Arvin decided to delete grey's photos in respect to grey's wishes. And
      what about stephine. She has no option. She's obsessed with grey till the
      last moment. She got some photos of him from him but they were not proper.
      At least they are enough to let her cry in preace. She went to the
      computer shop to recover every photo she had and she doesn't cares how
      much it might cost but she's willing to pay anything. But her phone get's
      stolen. She'll do anything at all to get her phone back and she tries to
      retreave it herself from everything cause the police aren't active enough
      and she does everything to get it back and almost get's killed over it
      cause the guy who stole it was really strong but she got saved. She
      managed to get her phone back but it was broken. She was so sad but turns
      out the sd card was right so she'll be able to get her photos back and she
      was so glad to find them back. She made hundreds of copies and made
      several cloud backups to remember grey. She will never forget him even if
      she died. A long time passes. Stephine is 26 years old. She's doing a job
      alone living and sota is quite old now. She is always dark circles on her
      eyes. She doesn't sleeps properly. She always looks at grey's photos when
      she goes to sleep and crys everyday. She got proposed by someone but she
      refused. Her colouges asked her why she did such thing and she says there
      was nothing wrong with that guy matter of fact he was just her type but
      she already has a person she loves. He may not be alive right now but
      he'll always existst in her heart. The little things he did to make her
      smile will always be reminded by her.
      <br />
      <br />
      On this side sota was old enough and went to grey's grave and decided to
      talk about how beautiful his life is. He wished grey was with him mocking
      how pethetic he is. On a different side arvin forgot that grey died and
      said why griffin didn't put grey on the list of invitation. Grffin looked
      at arvin in a wierd way. Maybe he's the one who is having trouble
      forgetting the past. one more year passes by and stephine is dead cause of
      depression.
